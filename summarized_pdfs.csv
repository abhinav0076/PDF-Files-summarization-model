In 2023,","This is our ninth annual Sustainability Report, outlining our approach  and progress from 1 January  to 31 December 2023. Our Sustainabiltiy Report is prepared on  a consolidated basis – all of our business  operations worldwide are in scope regardless of their function. In 2024, there will be changes to our  sustainability reporting in accordance with  new requirements including the EU Corporate  Sustainability Reporting Directive. AstraZeneca has reported the information cited in this GRI content index for the period from  1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023, with  reference to the GRI Standards. Assurance Bureau Veritas has provided limited assurance for sustainability activities reported in the sustainability  data annex and in the Annual Report 2023. Details are described in the Letters of Assurance, which are publicly available. Assurance is in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance  Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised) CVRM diseases are complex and  interconnected. It’s by understanding their  interconnections and targeting the mechanisms  that drive them that science can help patients. CVRM diseases are complex and interconnected. They are intensely difficult to treat. AstraZeneca’s sustainability report looks at what sustainability means at AstraZeneca. The aim is to improve and save the lives of the millions of patients living with these diseases. We’ll be able to detect,  diagnose and treat people earlier and more  effectively. Ethics and transparency is the focus of this report. Health system resilience and environmental protection are also key issues. The report also includes data annexes for access to healthcare and performance data. It is available in English, Spanish, French, German, and Italian. When we come together,  we can transform the  delivery of healthcare to  become more resilient,  equitable and net zero. Healthcare is our common foundation. It’s the bedrock of society, and when we’re healthy,  communities thrive and economies prosper. Health inequities in healthcare are growing from low- to high-income countries. The number of heat-related deaths could more than triple by 2050. We’re witnessing a steep  rise in heart and metabolic conditions, cancers and respiratory conditions. Healthcare sector responsible for around five per cent of global emissions. AstraZeneca is driving deep decarbonisation across its value chain. We’re investing $1 billion in our Ambition Zero Carbon strategy. The COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health was a milestone moment in recognising the urgent need to tackle the global climate- health crisis in 2023. The AZ Forest programme,  expanded in 2023 to a $400 million  initiative to plant and maintain 200 million trees by 2030. Learning from scientific and ecological  experts and local communities is central to our work. to reduce emissions  from the lab to the patient. The Sustainable Markets Initiative Health  Systems Task Force is a public-private partnership. It focuses on accelerating the delivery of healthcare to become more resilient, equitable and net zero. We embed this collaboration mindset across  all of our sustainability efforts, with 19.9 million trees planted to date. In 2023, we launched joint  environmental targets for suppliers, saw the establishment of a China Health Working Group, and recently concluded a multi-party agreement to access renewable power in China. The Partnership for Health System  Sustainability and Resilience is a further  example of our commitment. In Italy, clinical pathways for chronic  diseases are being reviewed to identify the  investments needed. In Japan, a digital medical  information platform is being prioritised. In Brazil, the improvement of community-based  prevention and disease management services is now a key area of focus. AstraZeneca is working with nine African governments and partners to prevent and control hypertension. Over nine million people with elevated blood pressure have been identified to date. Improving health system sustainability is  central to our flagship Healthy Heart Africa programme. We champion a culture of inclusion and belonging, recognising the power of diversity. In  our latest employee survey, 87 per cent said  they understand how they can contribute to  AstraZeneca’s sustainability priorities. In 2024, we remain focused on our commitment  to delivering positive impact for the health of people, society and our planet. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot: A sustainable future starts with health.

Economic and supply  barriers, as well as geographic impediments, inhibit universal access to high quality healthcare. We are working to remove barriers to  healthcare and give everyone the chance to be  as healthy as possible. In developing countries there is an epidemiological shift from the prevalence  of communicable to non-communicable  diseases (NCDs) Local healthcare  provision varies in quality and the systems may not be in place to tackle this growing  burden. Programmes to control priority public  health conditions also need to recognise the importance of the economic and social  determinants of health. We are committed to improving equitable access to healthcare for patients globally. To do this, we are. creating integrated approaches including through collaboration with governments and utilising local expertise to identify and  address shared priorities. We are also collaborating in cross-sector partnerships  to improve health outcomes. We seek to drive positive global health outcomes by addressing unmet medical need and barriers to access. We are playing our part to address health  inequities and eliminate discrimination. includes integrating programmes  into local systems and delivering affordable medicines to patients. We are transforming  healthcare to secure a future where all people have access to affordable, sustainable and innovative care. We are also harnessing the latest digital technologies to support improved  access. This includes using the power of data  and analytics for early diagnosis and expanding  access to the latest medical research. Everyone should have access to healthcare, no matter who they are or where they live. We are working to identify barriers to access and are innovating to deliver our life-changing medicines in a sustainable and equitable way. Central to this is integration with our strategy and business model. We are focused on delivering life-changing medicines and future-proofing global health systems. We are committed to promoting prevention, increasing access to diagnostics  and treatments, and strengthening health  system sustainability and resilience. We want to secure a future where all people have equitable  access to treatment.  progress is tracked against our Group People and Sustainability  strategic priority, including our ESG goals. We incentivise select senior executives  and in-country managers to perform on  access initiatives with financial and non- financial rewards. Our CEO also has access- related incentives linked to the company’s  ESG performance. We collaborate on our Access to healthcare  material focus areas on a cross-functional basis to deliver our strategy and measure progress. We also have a dedicated team within Global  Corporate Affairs who oversee progress  against targets and report on these to the Board Sustainability Committee. We are committed to  improving equitable access  to healthcare for patients globally. We are committed to designing clinical programmes with equity at the forefront – from idea inception to patient care. Our 11 Actions – key initiatives: Diversity in clinical trials and sustainability. There are more than 10,000 known rare  diseases, and the vast majority (>90%) are cancer. We are improving the diversity of clinical trial participants with strong data foundations, tools and standards. We work with industry groups, regulatory agencies and  local community groups to shape clinical trial  diversity policies. People with rare diseases deserve  the same attention and investment to find  and access therapies as anyone else. As  we expand the geographies where. do  not have an approved treatment. This means  that rare disease patients also face unique  challenges in pursuing equitable access  to healthcare. We focus on:  increasing clinical trial diversity; developing  improved data collection processes; improving access  to diagnostic tools; and supporting efforts  to improve the experience of those participating  in our clinical trials. our rare  disease medicines are available, we continue  to build relationships with patient communities early in our development programmes to  better understand their needs. AstraZeneca recognises our role in helping to  make our products accessible and affordable to patients in need. Our Commitment to Deliver  Our Science to Patients details our efforts to  address barriers our patients face. Those efforts include our approach to IP. AstraZeneca does not file patent applications in any low- income countries. Reducing time to diagnosis and engaging policymakers are critical to advancing equitable access for rare disease patients. AstraZeneca prioritise the countries where we seek patent protection. Healthy Heart Africa (HHA), Young  Health Programme (YHP), and Healthy Lung  programmes by 2025. More than 66.4 million people reached  (cumulative) through HHA, YHP and   Healthy Lung programmes. Total community investment (not including patient assistance programmes) $115.4m. Company policy and programming, including core pricing principles and access programmes. We are committed to addressing barriers  to access and affordability. Our industry,  policymakers and payers need to work together  to identify solutions. Through collaborations,  partnerships and stakeholder partnerships. There are challenges that  affect our flexibility to provide access to our medicines. These include pricing controls,  reimbursement mechanisms, taxation and  mark-up systems. In addition, supply  chain complexity can increase costs, and the  economic downturn is adversely affecting  ability to pay (where applicable) We take a broad, flexible  approach to pricing to reflect the variation  in healthcare systems. We are committed  to working in partnership with patients,  policymakers, payers and the wider healthcare  community to ensure access is as equitable,  widespread and as sustainable as possible. AstraZeneca has adopted four key pricing principles that are designed among other things  to support our affordability efforts globally. Sustainability: of both the healthcare system  and our research-led business model. Value: reflects the clinical benefit of our medicines to patients and the broader impact  on society. Access: collaboration with payers. Tiered pricing is a key enabler for broader and accelerated patient access in LMICs. We do this by linking the cost of medicines with  government and patient ability to pay based on  macroeconomic indicators of local affordability. Value-based agreements enable patient access while reducing uncertainty for payers. They link access, reimbursement  or price to real-world clinical benefit or other  agreed terms. We work closely with governments, private  and public payers, and in some cases individual  patients. Our largest patient  assistance programme is AZ&Me in the United  States, which provides eligible patients with AstraZeneca medicines free of charge. Our patient access programmes, including  patient assistance programmes, use fully  donated products, without expectation of  payment from the patient for any portion. PAPs. aim to close the gap in the ability to pay of patients who  fund their own medicines. We track  PAPs in 25 countries, most of which are LMICs where we adopt different programme types. Examples include fixed PAP schemes, tiered  P APs, co-pay support, micro-financing  and bridging programmes. $4,778.8m reached by patient  access programmes. 862,632 people. Sustainability  overview Access to   healthcare Environmental  protection Ethics and   transparency Data  annex Access to healthcare 13 Health system  resilience Scope of this focus area To  strengthen health systems, by: Partnering with stakeholders in the development of research-based recommendations, advocating for health  system policy reform and building capabilities to strengthen the delivery of health services. Improving access to quality healthcare and providing solutions along a continuum of care – from prevention, awareness, diagnosis and  treatment to post-treatment and wellness. Health system capacity remains under  pressure. The shifting burden of disease, geopolitical  fragmentation and the frequency of extreme  weather events linked to the climate emergency all put pressure on health systems. The  COVID-19 pandemic tested health systems’  ability to respond to sudden shocks and crises. Health system resilience and capacity  must be strengthened. at global, regional and local levels. outbreaks of infectious diseases such as  respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza,  as well as the increasing prevalence of NCDs. Net-zero health systems improve patient outcomes and limit the environmental impact of care. Equitable health systems ensure everyone is  able to live their healthiest life, by removing barriers to early disease detection, accurate diagnosis, access to clinical trials and high-quality therapies. Our integrated approach  puts health at the centre of a sustainable future. We are investing in ground-breaking global collaborations, company needs. As shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, we learned what can be achieved when we  collaborate at speed and at scale. International coordination on scenario planning, response protocols and reserve capacities. Optimising the location and focus of  patient care through digital technologies. Addressing the social, economic,   and ecological costs of disease through. initiatives, local partnerships and fast-tracked innovation. We aim to build the capabilities of  health systems to best respond to patient needs. We ensure programming is locally and culturally relevant. Using our footprint to scale. Improving the effectiveness of care for chronic diseases through defining,  implementing and monitoring improved quality of care standards.  partnerships and collaborations. Establishing mechanisms for collaboration  with our partners, for example through joint coordination, planning, follow-up and alignment on key performance indicators. Keeping the communities we serve at the  heart of our partnerships by involving them in the design and delivery of services.  Partnership for Health System  Sustainability and Resilience (PHSSR)  The PHSSR is a non-profit, multi-sector,  global collaboration established in 2020 by  the London School of Economics, the World Economic Forum and AstraZeneca. Its goal is to improve global health by building more sustainable and resilient health systems. The PHSSR has built, and continues  to expand upon, one of the largest bodies of  work on the sustainability and resilience of health systems globally. It is now active in more than  30 countries worldwide. Global experts work  with national academics and policymakers to  understand health systems. The PHSSR is activating global leaders and partnering with national stakeholders to drive  focused interventions and policy change. In 2023, PHSSr has engaged with over 40  national and regional stakeholders to develop tailored recommendations that can be actioned. It has published its second summary  report, capturing research conducted in  18 countries. Our Healthy Heart Africa (HHA) programme is committed to reducing hypertension and the burden of cardiovascular disease. We aim to reach 10 million people with elevated blood  pressure across Africa by 2025. Sustainability  overview Access to   healthcare Environmental  protection Ethics and   transparency Data  annex By the end of 2023, the programme had conducted  more than 47.9 million blood pressure  screenings and trained more than 11,300  healthcare workers. In 2023 the programme launched in eight of 10  new countries planned by 2024. Our Young Health Programme (YHP) aims to  empower young people to make more informed choices about their health. It is now active in 40 countries worldwide, combining community programmes, research, advocacy and supporting the development of young leaders. With a focus on vulnerable and under-resourced communities. The YHP has directly reached more than 15 million young people and trained more than 580,000 youth as Peer Educators since its launch in 2010. In 2023, the YHP reached  more than five million youngpeople through  prevention and education programmes. In 2023,  we contributed $115.4 million in financial and  non-financial donations to more than 810 non-profit partners across 76 countries. We also donated  $4.7 billion of medicines through patient  assistance programmes around the world. Train 170,000 healthcare workers to strengthen health systems throughout the world by 2025. More than 127,300 healthcare workers  trained (cumulative) Status: On plan See data annex   for full metrics. 1,516  healthcare workers were activated through our Healthy  Heart Africa programme. Sustainability  overview Access to   healthcare Environmental  protection Ethics and   transparency Data  annex Environmental protection Our ambition Accelerating the delivery of net-zero  healthcare, proactively managing our  environmental impact across all activities. Supporting a healthy environment is critical to the health of people, society, and the planet. 2023 performance 67.6% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions since 2015. 19.9m trees planted in Australia, Brazil, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Rwanda, Rwanda. increasing  prevalence of diseases linked to the  impacts of climate change. 97.6% of paper-based product packaging materials used supplied from sustainable sources. 750+ material suppliers with a critical role in patient supply screened to understand  climate vulnerability in the upstream value chain. Environmental  protection Recognising the  interconnection between  a healthy planet and  healthy people. We know that ecosystems are vital to shape a  healthy future with resilient people and communities. We know that our use of the planet’s finite natural resources is sustainable. Our contribution to society must  respect our environment and ensure that our  use of  resources is sustainable. We are committed to building harmony between society and the natural environment. A healthy environment is critical for human health. Climate change, pollution and the degradation of ecosystems are already impacting human  health. Bold  climate action and investments in nature  and biodiversity are vital to improve health  outcomes. The environmental challenges we face are multifaceted and ecosystem. Systems-level thinking is needed to deliver better health outcomes with a lower environmental footprint. There is increasing focus on the environmental  footprint of goods and services across the  whole value chain. Companies are also under  greater scrutiny, reinforcing the need to have robust scientific evidence underpinning  environmental targets. Sustainable product design, sourcing and manufacturing aim to achieve lower natural resource use, reduced chemical and water demand, and generate less waste and pollution. We follow the science to lower the economic  and environmental burden of healthcare,  while improving health outcomes and reducing our exposure to environmental  risks. At AstraZeneca, we are  demonstrating that this can be achieved  alongside business growth, but there is more  to do. By investing in new ways of working and through innovative collaborations, we can maximise the efficiency of how we use natural resources. We have a dedicated  Natural Resource Efficiency Fund (NREF),  which has invested approximately $175 million  in environmental efficiency projects since 2015. This, together with other central capital  investments, has seen a further $36.6 million  spent in 2023, including 72 new projects. We support the Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures (TCFD) All our  business operations worldwide are in scope,  unless otherwise stated. Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, which  we have applied annually since 2020. We will build resilience across  the value chain through adaptation and  business continuity planning. AstraZeneca says it is aware of the risks and opportunities posed by climate change. The company says mitigation measures are already in place. AstraZeneca is committed to providing net-zero healthcare by the end of the century. It says it has a long-term view of how climate change will affect its business. Failure to meet regulatory or  ethical expectations on environmental impact, including climate change, is not currently considered to be a Principal Risk for the Group. For further details on TCFD please see  pages 51-53 in the Annual Report 2023 and our TCFD Report. AstraZeneca. operate in an environmentally  responsible manner, working to minimise our  reliance and impact on natural resources. The guide  for our Environmental Management System is  embedded in our Code of Ethics supported by our Safety, Health, and Environment (SHE)  Standard. Our SHE management system is implemented in line with recognised international standards such as ISO 14001 and 50001. It ensures  the environmental risks of our activities are  assessed, operational controls are in place and checks are completed through a risk-based  audit programme. In 2023, this Governance Group included  our CEO, CFO, and the EVP, Global Operations,  IT & Chief Sustainability Officer. Delivery of Ambition Zero Carbon  Scope 1 and 2 commitments has been included  in our executive incentive arrangements for the  Performance Share Plan (PSP) The PSP is determined by the Board’s  Remuneration Committee and weighting  of 10% of award. GHG emissions are calculated in line with the World Resources  Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable  Development GHG Protocol methodology. To achieve net zero by avoiding GHG  emissions through our product and facility design, optimising energy efficiency, shifting  to renewable energy sources, transitioning  to a battery electric vehicle (BEV) fleet, and investing in battery electric vehicles. approved by the  Annual General Meeting. About 5% of GHG emissions are from the healthcare sector. We are working to deliver net-zero healthcare. To build resilience by managing the physical (sites, supply chain) and transitional (regulatory, technological, market and reputational) risks and opportunities. A significant proportion of our value chain  footprint results from our product lifecycle. Pharmaceutical products have a long  development cycle, which makes it critical to  design in and embed climate considerations at an early stage. To achieve our goals, we  must also tackle emissions from our existing  commercial portfolio, which creates challenges. ""We need  to increase a shared understanding with our  suppliers,"" the company says. ""By enabling suppliers to reduce their  GHG emissions, we can reduce our own  Scope 3 emissions and achieve our  net-zero targets"" Other challenges include difficulties in accessing renewable sources of heat. The global transition to BEVs is being impeded by a lack of vehicles and charging infrastructure in some markets. The supply of vehicles has improved and we are on plan to transition by the end of 2025 where technically feasible. Through our Ambition Zero Carbon strategy,  we are pursuing ambitious science-based decarbonisation targets. We follow the science to understand  the climate and health nexus and set targets. We follow a hierarchy to address each  emission source (eliminate-reduce-substitute) We recognise the importance of our supply  chain and suppliers. We engage with,  educate, support and incentivise to act. We are transparent about our performance, methodologies, transition plan and assessment of climate-related risks. We have nature-based and technical measures in place to identify and address physical climate risks at site level and in local business continuity planning. We focus on delivering absolute reductions in all our direct sources through the Energize and Activate collaborations.

For more detail, see Ambition  Zero Carbon infographic. We have achieved a 17.5% absolute  reduction in total energy consumption from our  2015 baseline. We are committed to using 100% renewable energy sources to meet all  our needs by the end of 2025. As part of our  renewable energy strategy we investigated  how to maximise the positive impact of our renewable energy procurement. We are aiming for over half of our renewable energy globally to come from new sources. Energy purchase agreements deliver real world GHG  emissions reductions by displacing fossil energy sources in the grid systems where  we consume that energy. Energy attribute  certificates (EACs) that are tagged with the  time and date of generation can improve the efficiency of energy production. We are aiming to better understand, disclose  and improve the alignment between when  our energy is generated and consumed. In 2021, we transitioned to 100% imported  electricity from certified renewable sources through purchasing certificates from the same  country, and same year, as our consumption. As we were unable to purchase renewable  electricity certificates for Russia in 2022, this is our transition. We have spent  $19.4 million from 2022 to 2023 on on-site  solar photovoltaic (PV) installations at nine  locations in seven countries. Once operational, the once operational,  once operational. reduced to 99% and has been maintained in  2023. There is a limit to the  scale that can be achieved through on-site solar PV. We are aiming to meet most of  our electricity needs in our primary locations – Sweden, UK and US – through new power  purchase agreements (PPAs) In 2023 we entered into a 10-year  PPA agreement with Statkraft, Europe’s largest  renewable energy producer. This  provides additional zero carbon electricity to the  grid and will correspond to approximately 80%  of our total electricity needs at our Gothenburg and Södertälje sites. We are striving to develop  new sustainable sources of  energy to achieve our Ambition  Zero Carbon targets. heating and cooling  sources globally is very limited. Our approach to each of our locations prioritises demand reduction in the first instance and the assessment of electrification options. Since 2022, we have been developing a  solution for our US sites, which are collectively  our largest-consuming market for fossil  gas globally. In 2023, we collaborated with  Vanguard Renewables to enable the delivery of  renewable natural gas (RNG – biomethane) to  all our sites in the contiguous US by the end of 2026. From June 2023,. we began purchasing  RNG produced by Vanguard Renewable for  our Newark campus in Delaware, and by 2026, this collaboration will enable up to 190. solutions. In 2023, AstraZeneca entered into a 15-year agreement with Future Biogas to establish the first unsubsidised industrial-scale supply of biomethane in the UK. This supply of green  gas will contribute to heat for our sites in  Macclesfield, Cambridge, Luton and Speke. GWh of biomethane,  equivalent to 19% of our total global gas consumption. Using crops grown locally as part of diverse crop rotations. Supporting UK farms with sustainable  land management practices. We need to increase shared  understanding with our  suppliers, investing time to help align with our expectations. The SMI Health Systems Task Force, convened by AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot, is partnering across the healthcare sector to accelerate the delivery of net-zero health systems. This includes through supply chain decarbonisation and patient care pathways, and  the use of digital innovation in clinical research. China and India are key markets for pharmaceuticals manufacturing. Estimated to account for up to 50% of materials  for medicines. AstraZeneca was one of five global healthcare leaders – including four members of the Task Force – announced in January 2024. In July 2023,  AstraZeneca’s CEO was one of seven global. CEOs to sign an industry-first renewable power  agreement in China, with leading renewable  energy company Envision Energy. In March 2023 the Task Force announced joint,  minimum climate and sustainability targets  for suppliers. Schneider joined other global pharmaceutical  companies in accelerating the decarbonisation of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) supply  chains. We were a founding member of Energize,  a collaboration between Schneider and other pharmaceutical companies. We also helped suppliers gain access to green  funding and support through the Activate  Programme.  286 AstraZeneca suppliers have registered with the programme. The programme’s first PPA buyers’ cohort to purchase 2 TWh  renewable electricity announced in November 2022. In 2023, a partnership was announced between Energize  and the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy across the pharmaceutical sector. We are tackling 20% of our Scope 3 footprint through our commitment to developing a next-generation pressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) using the propellant HFO-1234ze(E) We are working to build transparent supply  chains by asking our partners to assess  and disclose their GHG emissions. Programme, with 708 suppliers (59% of in-scope spend). Targets and progress Ambition Zero Carbon Target Progress Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions  by 98% by 2026, from a 2015 base year.

Sustainability  overview Access to   healthcare Environmental  protection Ethics and  transparency Data  annex Environmental protection 20 Product  sustainability Scope of this focus area To follow processes throughout the life cycle of our products. See data annex  for full metrics. As technologies and healthcare systems evolve, so should solutions to reduce energy, water, material use, waste. People and the planet will benefit from those medicines which have the smallest possible  environmental impact yet maintain the highest  medical efficacy and safety standards. GHG  emissions from our product value chains are  the most significant contribution to our company Scope 3 emissions. We are  addressing these across our business using  a data-driven approach. Pharmaceuticals enter the environment  mainly from patient use, where some can  pass through our bodies and into waterways. Drug manufacture and the improper disposal of unused medicines can  add to the trace levels of pharmaceuticals in rivers, lakes, soils, and sometimes drinking water. We recognise that, even in very low  concentrations, the risks associated with Pharmaceuticals in the Environment should be determined and managed. We aim to deliver medicines that improve patient outcomes and minimise the burden on the planet. We evaluate and aim to address the environmental impact of materials and processes across the entire product value chain. We have implemented an internal Product  Sustainability Index (PSI) to understand the  environmental impacts of our products. Sustainable decision-making and  environmental improvements are embedded across the product life cycle. Integrated business processes to  ensure safety, health and environmental  aspects are considered throughout drug development. Guidance on environmental assessment of API manufacturing, formulation, packaging and devices. AstraZeneca's life cycle assessment (LCA) programme determines the type and magnitude of environmental impacts across our product value chains. LCA is in line with ISO standards 14040 and 14044. AstraZeneca invests in new science and disruptive research. We are working on redesigning our packaging to make it more sustainable. We are a leading partner in collaborations to drive common standards for illustrating the environmental footprints of our medicines. We follow a life cycle approach that covers all stages of our products Patient use  Packaging Next-generation pressurised  metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) Essential medicines for respiratory diseases include pMDIs which rely on fluorinated  gases (F-gases) as propellants. Governments are developing legislation to phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), a type of F-gas. AstraZeneca supports  the phase down of these high Global Warming  Potential (GWP) propellants. It is critical, however, that legislation avoids the risk of limiting access to life-saving inhaled medicines for patients. An important product-related element of our Ambition Zero Carbon strategy is our  commitment to developing a next-generation pMDI using the F-gas. HFO-1234ze(E) has near-zero GWP. In 2023, project  milestones achieved include further Phase III  investment decisions, a harmonised  development programme defined globally. Readouts of pivotal studies and initiation of key  studies needed to file for regulatory approval. As part of the European Commission’s pollution  reduction strategy, updates and changes to pharmaceutical and chemical regulations could influence the way medicines are manufactured and approved in future. Monitoring these  regulatory risks, providing evidence-based  responses to ongoing consultations, and  proactively managing the chemicals used in our processes will help minimise the impact on supply. The SMI Health Systems  Task Force has worked with the Pharmaceutical  Environment Group (PEG) through a newly  created consortium. The consortium  and NHS England intend to work with the  British NHS. of  medicines to patients. The LCA standard will improve transparency and support the assessment and reduction of the environmental  impact of medicines across their manufacture,  supply, use and end of product life. Standards Institution (BSI) to reach a  consensus among the sector’s stakeholder groups including healthcare systems, providers and professionals. Ecopharmacovigilance (EPV) is our approach  to understanding pharmaceuticals in the environment. Our EPV process reviews  emerging science and literature, looking for  new information that might change the way  we assess the environmental risks associated with our APIs. Our industry-leading dashboard,  where users can visualise the relative risks of our APIs that are found in  the environment, is available on our website. The IHI PREMIER consortium is a public-private partnership between the European Commission and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations. We are helping develop tools to identify potential  environmental risks of APIs and make these tools and data more accessible to all  stakeholders. In 2023, we published an evidence-led prioritisation for PIE. As part of our engagement with the IHI,  AstraZeneca has joined a coalition of  pharmaceutical companies to co-fund a major initiative. The initiative will progress the sustainable  manufacture of healthcare products and their  quantitative environmental impact, due to start in 2024. 90% of total syntheses meet resource  efficiency targets at launch by 2025. For the remainder,  continuous improvement work is ongoing in  process development functions to maximise  resource efficiency. We work to balance the  priority to provide pharmaceuticals. from  across the EU to contribute to sustainable  development of pharmaceutical manufacture, use and disposal. 99% of API discharges from AstraZeneca sites and 94% from direct suppliers were in compliance. Out of 42 measurements for one API, at a single site, one sample marginally (1.4-fold) exceeded our  safe discharge target. Site improvements have been agreed. exceedance lasted  less than 5 days and, based on available  data, was not considered to impact the  environment. The cause has been identified and site improvements are being made. See data annex for full metrics. We are committed to reducing our impact on the planet through responsible sourcing and efficient, circular use and disposal of natural resources across the value chain. We recognise that a healthy environment is  inextricably linked to health outcomes. We are also committed to protecting ecosystems to improve health outcomes and tackle environmental drivers of disease. We need to operate within our  planetary boundaries for a healthy planet. linked to the health of people and  society. We are taking action to protect and restore  ecosystems by limiting environmental impacts across our value chain. The conservation  and sustainable use of natural resources and the protection and restoration of ecosystems are vital. Supply chains from the pharmaceutical sector are highly complex, making it difficult to define our impacts and dependencies on nature. Many materials  needed to produce medicines are hazardous in  nature and difficult to replace, generating waste  streams that are challenging to manage. We are committed to reducing our impact  on the planet and investing in nature and  biodiversity to benefit planetary and societal  health. We recognise that adopting circular  business approaches and implementing efficient efficient reuse, recycle or  repurpose. These factors mean cross-sectoral  collaboration with suppliers, regulators, and  other companies and organisations. Our medicines are key to reducing natural resources used in our value chains. Incorporate the principles of the circular economy into the design of all our processes and products, from initial  research and development through to production. regenerate nature and use renewable natural resources instead of non-renewable ones. We aim to minimise the amount of materials required and waste generated during manufacture and use of our products. To do this, we are leveraging our experience with lean manufacturing, which includes tools  to enhance efficiency and eliminate waste. We are embedding recognised best practices from partners such as My My. Green Lab aims to decouple water use and waste generation from business growth. The company also empowers employees across its global network to identify and implement ideas that contribute to its environmental targets. Green Lab is moving beyond efficiency within the company and into our  business as usual. We are working to make positive contributions to nature and local communities near our sites. We are also working to  embed emerging best practice into our own  operations and across our supply chain, for  example using tools and guidance that Science  Based Targets for Nature (SBTN) is. ""We have  committed to developing a framework to  systematically assess biodiversity risks  and dependencies across our value chain"" ""We will build on this knowledge  to ensure all agricultural, forestry and marine- derived materials used in our products and  research activities are safe"" We are also committed to demonstrating key forest risk commodities are free from  deforestation and ecosystem conversion by 2025. We are also furthering our commitment to  assess and minimise environmental impacts  from our supply chain. While making progress  on our existing responsible sourcing targets. We are building a risk-based approach to assess additional new and existing materials’ impacts and  dependencies on nature. This is helping prepare us for future reporting to the Taskforce on  Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) In 2023, we announced an expansion of our AZ  Forest programme, raising our commitment to  plant and ensure the long-term survival of 200  million trees by 2030. This includes new or expanded projects  in Brazil, India, Vietnam, Ghana, Rwanda and Kenya. The investment builds on our initial AZ Forest commitment, announced in 2020. Since launch,  planting has progressed at pace, with over 19.9  million trees planted across Australia, Brazil,  Ghana, India, Indonesia, Rwanda, the UK, and the US. AZ Forest projects are co-designed with planting experts, local communities and  governments to deliver natural forest restoration and agroforestry. Co-benefits include the creation of new skills and jobs, the protection  and recovery of threatened and endangered species and improved public health. We have partnered with the European Forest  Institute (EFI) and Circular Bioeconomy Alliance (CBA) to publish  Site waste circularity rate. The CBA Principles  for Regenerative Landscapes support the Site Total  Recycle (t) and Site External   Waste Avoided (t). AZ Forest contributes to the World Economic  Forum’s 1t.org initiative to conserve, restore and grow  one trillion trees by 2030. In 2023, we introduced a new site waste  circularity rate metric across our sites. New metric will focus efforts at the top of  the waste hierarchy and drive improvements in circularity. Taskforce on Nature-related  Financial Disclosures (TNFD) We are beginning to identify our impacts and  dependencies on nature across our value chain. Starting in 2024, we will invest $5 million per year to fund nature restoration and water stewardship projects in the communities where we operate. We need to operate within  our planetary boundaries for a healthy planet. Reduce water use by 20% below the 2015  baseline by 2025.

Everyone feels valued and respected because of their individual abilities and perspectives. Drive the highest standards of conduct  and accountability beyond compliance. Product safety, use of human tissue and animals for research, human rights  and building supplier capabilities to uphold  high social standards. Norway, Canada and Germany have implemented legislation mandating human  rights due diligence and greater transparency. The EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence  Directive also requires companies to consider social and environmental impacts,  with a focus on standards. The expanded interest in and use of Artificial  Intelligence (AI) creates opportunities  for improved patient engagement and data  analysis but also increases data privacy and  data use concerns. We must ensure that we  meet regulatory and stakeholder expectations  around responsible use of AI, as well as  data protection and security. Building trust by demonstrating integrity,  transparency and fair  treatment is central to  everything we do. 26 ambition is to achieve 100% ethical spend,  ensuring we only work with suppliers that  share our Values. Our approach fosters our  suppliers’ integrity and transparency. In 2023 we continued our partnership  with EcoVadis to assess our suppliers’  environmental, ethical, and social performance. Of the 70% of our suppliers (by spend) that  were assessed, 66% achieved an acceptable  score of more than 45. AstraZeneca is committed to the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) of animals in research.

Based on a culture of learning  and improvement rather than blame. We must foster an environment where people feel safe, energised and inspired. The resources  we put into supporting the physical and mental  health and safety of our workforce are an  investment in society at large. Contributing to  a safe and healthy environment is the right  thing to do. Through our Global Standards we are  committed to maintaining or exceeding  compliance with all local company, legal and  regulatory requirements. Our (SHE) Standard, is  covered by our Code of Ethics and supported by our OneSHE Framework and accompanying ‘SHE: Everybody’s Business’ training. We manage SHE risks, opportunities,  and performance by using effective management systems. We work with  regulators, vendors, and our own Legal function to ensure we maintain compliance within the various local regulatory frameworks that apply. This requires engagement  throughout the organisation, effective  leadership, open communication, and  a  ‘Plan, Do,  Check, Act’ process. AZ SHE System provides a single,  transparent source of SHE data across  our enterprise. This drives innovation in the  management and reporting of SHE events and  sustainability metrics. By collecting data from  504 locations and 81 countries on SHE events, we have quick notification of and response. In 2023 we have increased our focus to assure compliance with local SHE legislation and company Global SHE standards. We have partnered with an external vendor to  scan for SHE regulatory information. This further enables us to ensure  safety and health initiatives are focused on the right areas. We launched a Serious Injury and Fatality  Prevention and Mitigation Programme in 2021. It is led by our Global SHE team and guided by a  senior-level steering committee. Process and  life safety subject matter experts evaluate high-risk activities with the potential to result in a serious injury or fatality. In 2023 we implemented the final year of our  three-year plan to address 12 high-risk areas. This involves  leaders watching the findings and past events. Besides reviewing and  uplifting existing standards and materials,  followed by a gap assessment at site-level. AstraZeneca's Drive Success driver safety campaign aims to protect employees and communities. AstraZeneca responded to an increasing  collision trend by developing a safe driving  campaign. The  successful approach to focus on hazardous  activities is now being built into existing ways of working. In 2023 the CPMK  was 1.96, exceeding the 2.5 target for the year. This campaign continued into 2023 and has  shown a positive impact on collisions per  million kilometres (CPMK) In 2025 the target for  2025 of 1.90 is on course to be met or exceeded.

The classes covered the entire application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design and verification process. “Semiconductors are at the heart of  America’s strength, enabling the essential  technologies that drive economic growth and national security,” Intel said. Intel provided funding to Technological University Dublin to purchase a benchtop scanning electron microscope to upgrade  its microelectronics facility clean room capabilities. The upgrade  will enhance training of over 500 engineering and science students across three campuses. semiconductors projected to increase  significantly by 2030 and beyond. Intel provided support to enable four universities to upgrade and  expand their VLSI and semiconductor programs. In addition, funding was allocated to Maynooth  University to support creation of the May nooth University Robotics Laboratory, where 180 students will learn from practical exercises and  projects each year. Intel is helping to modernize the  semiconductor curriculum of three other technology colleges. Intel provided curriculum funding to upgrade VLSI programs at both the Costa Rica Institute of Technology and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (CINVESTAV) in Mexico. Intel facilitated 20 Intel FPGA curriculum adoptions and conducted workshops and national faculty development programs that trained some 2,000 students and, 1,200 faculty members at more  than 100 institutions in 2023. In. collaborated with leading universities to enhance their  curriculum in areas such as VLSI design, AI, and data science. Close to 1,200 students from  22 colleges were trained in a virtual six-week Intel® Unnati Industrial Training program. To train students in industry-relevant areas for the regional workforce, Intel funded the development of new semiconductor curriculum in three universities. We are expanding our existing operations in Arizona, New Mexico,  and Oregon, and investing in two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio. We are committed to strengthening the resilience of the global  semiconductor supply chain by investing in geographically balanced manufacturing capacity. We have submitted all four of our major project proposals to the US. These projects are estimated to represent over  $100 billion of US manufacturing and research investments over the next five years. In the EU and Israel, we have announced a series of investments spanning our existing operations in Ireland and Israel. We have also announced our plans to invest  up to $4.6 billion in an  wafer fabrication mega-site. Intel teams across the globe are installing new tools, delivering new  clean rooms, and completing construction of new buildings. In 2023, about 145,000 tons  of steel—roughly the weight of 20,743 African elephants—was used in  our construction and expansion projects. Intel has completed the “cheese slab’ concrete pour, which forms the base of the fab level of our two upcoming factories, Fab 52 and Fab 62. Teams also poured over 2 million cubic yards of concrete—enough to build the  Empire State Building 32 times over. Construction teams moved 1 million cubic yards of dirt over the past year, and fitted 4,300 tons of steel rebar. Later this year, teams will install and qualify more tools at Fabs 9 and 11x, also in Rio Rancho. While most of the work in 2023 was below  ground level, the next milestone will be the construction of the above- ground building. MSB2 is a new support building adjacent to the  existing D1X fab, Intel’s largest technology development site. By the end of 2024, the lower level of MSB2 should be online and fab teams will  begin using the building as the arrival hub for D1x's cutting-edge fab tools. Fab 34 in Leixlip celebrated the start of high-volume manufacturing using Intel 4 and EUV technology in January 2024. Kiryat Gat, currently home to Intel’s most advanced manufacturing  facility in Israel, will soon welcome Fab 38. Later this year, construction teams will begin work on Fab 38, which will be located adjacent to Fab 28. In 2024, Intel Israel marks a special milestone—50 years of operation. In June 2023, Intel and the German government inked a fresh agreement to increase the scope of our wafer fabrication site in Magdeburg. The agreement encompasses Intel’s increased investment  in the site. Intel is making a $7 billion investment at our site in Penang, Malaysia. In June 2023, Intel revealed plans for a new assembly test  manufacturing facility in Wrocław that will support about 2,000 employees. In addition, in Kulim, Intel’s fifth assembly test manufacturing factory in Malaysia is under construction. The $4.6 billion project is the largest greenfield investment  in the history of Poland. The location was chosen for several reasons, including its existing infrastructure, a strong talent base, and an excellent  business environment. Later in 2024, we expect our teams will be busy  with design and submission for construction permits. More than 80% of enterprises will have used generative APIs or deployed generative AI-enabled applications by 2026, up from under  5% in 2023. But with this growth, significant environmental impacts will be created, according to the report. Gartner predicts that by 2025, AI will consume more energy than the human workforce without sustainable AI practices. IDC also forecasts a steep climb in data center energy consumption, partially driven by generative AI, anticipating growth from 382 terawatt-hours in 2022 to 802 by 2027. 77% of senior IT leaders believe that ‘transformational IT’ is high on their corporate agenda. Intel Core™ Ultra processors feature  new neural processing units to execute AI-based tasks. 4.4 Intel® Core Ultra processors feature new neural processing units. Intel Core Ultra processors consume up to 38% lower processor power than the previous generation. For  instance, combining real-time data collection with AI can help businesses identify areas for operational improvement to help reduce carbon emissions at scale. Transformative efforts driving environmental  responsibility need not conflict with AI. The right hardware, software, tools, and  design can accelerate innovation and maximize the impact of AI workloads’ energy footprint at every stage of the pipeline. AI can offer a direct path to the high-impact results that can significantly  decrease an organization's environmental impact. Intel has taken on the challenge to  reduce energy consumption with AI workloads through comprehensive measures, including platform innovations. AI can also  help accelerate the Tech Positive6 innovation of much-needed climate-  friendly technologies and outcomes. Our mission is sustainable computing for a sustainable future, and  we believe AI is critical to that goal.

For more information, see ‘Product Ecology’ and ‘ product energy’ We recognize that innovation, growth,  and the success of our business and our industry depend on individuals’  trust in their use of technology. We also do not tolerate our products  being used to violate human rights. For more detail, see “Respecting  Human Rights” At Intel, our goal  is to build the most secure hardware on the planet. We are frequently innovating and enhancing  security capabilities for our products. System trust is rooted in security. If hardware isn’t secure, then a system cannot be secure. The 2023 Intel Product Security Reportdemonstrates our  Security First Pledge and our regular efforts to proactively seek out  and mitigate security issues. We prioritize security in two ways: in the way we work, through our  culture and practices aimed at delivering high performance and  protections in everything we build; and in what we work on. Security Technologies Strategy. Security Technologies Strategy understands the complexity that  results from the ongoing computing transformation. We engineer security solutions to meet specific challenges centered around three key priorities: foundational security, workload protection, and data protection. We have deep  experience in enabling security, as well as a comprehensive suite of  technologies that help secure entire systems and deliver defense in  depth. Security Development  Lifecycle (SDL) applies security and privacy principles at six phases. SDL covers Intel® hardware, firmware, and software products. Our Bug Bounty is an essential part of our product support for security research and mitigations. Intel incentivizes  security researchers to report vulnerabilities in Intel products. We reward  researchers with bonus multipliers for findings in specific areas of interest. When a vulnerability is  identified, we work with affected organizations to develop and release  mitigations. Security Development Lifecycle Security Research. Continued improvement is made through investments  in offensive research on the security of our products. This work is scaled through practices that include red teaming  and hackathons. We use what we learn to improve our products and  practices. Intel’s sourcing and manufacturing practices are built on decades of experience designed to align to industry-leading processes. Our supply chain security program leverages this expertise and has embedded security controls throughout the vendor lifecycle. For more information, read our Security-  First Pledge or the 2023 Intel Product Security Report. Security expectations begin at supplier selection. Expectations are  then reinforced through contractual security terms and conditions. Security key  performance indicators, and recurrent required training are also part of the program. Our. management program is derived  from standard industry risk management frameworks such as  NIST and ISO. Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) program executes hundreds of information security supplier audits annually. The program is designed to align to standard industry information security management frameworks, including ISO and NIST. We monitor the cybersecurity posture of our suppliers through a third-party security ratings platform. Non-GAAP financial measures presented here should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. See  “Non- GAAP Financial Measures” in the  Appendix for additional information  and reconciliations to comparable  GAAP figures. We believe that our integrated approach to financial matters, corporate  governance, and corporate responsibility drives increased accountability,  improves decision making, and ultimately creates long-term value. In line with the International Integrated Reporting Council’s International <IR>  framework and six capitals concept, we have outlined how we deploy  capital to execute our strategy. Each of our six forms of capital plays a critical role in  our long-term value creation. We take a disciplined approach to our financial capital  allocation strategy, which continues to focus on building stakeholder  value. Our first allocation priority is to invest in the business and capacity and our capital needs. In 2023,  we declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock. This  dividend reduction reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation,  is expected to support the critical investments needed. invest in R&D  and capital spending to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the  world’s demand for semiconductors. During 2023, we  paid $3.1 billion in dividends. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the  past 125 quarters. In addition, our capital allocation strategy includes opportunistic  investment in and acquisition of companies that complement our  strategic objectives. ""We also seek to drive value creation  through transactions such as the 2022 Mobileye IPO, the 2023 minority  stake sales in IMS, and the 20 23 announcement of our intent to operate  Altera,® an Intel company (formerly PSG),"" the company said. Intel exited numerous businesses in the last three years, including the  NAND memory business and Intel® Optane™ memory business. We take action when investments do not strategically align to our key priorities. For additional 2023 financial information, see the 2023 Intel  Annual Report on Form 10-K. We strategically invest financial capital to continue  to build our business, create long-term value, and  provide returns to our stockholders. our stakeholders. Invest significantly in R&D and IP to enable  us to deliver on our accelerated process  technology roadmap, introduce leading x86 and x86 processors.  xPU products, and develop new  businesses and capabilities. We develop IP to enable next-generation products,  create synergies across our businesses, expand  into new markets, and establish and support our  brands. Build manufacturing capacity efficiently to meet the growing long-term global demand for semiconductors. Build a diverse, inclusive, and safe work  environment to attract, develop, and retain top talent needed to build transformative  products. Social and  Relationship Build trusted relationships for both Intel  and our stakeholders, including employees. Our talented employees enable the development  of solutions and enhance the intellectual and manufacturing capital critical to helping our  customers win the technology inflections of the future. Natural Strive to reduce our environmental footprint through efficient and responsible use of natural resources and materials used to create our products. We collaborate with stakeholders on programs  to empower underserved communities through  education and technology. We also advance accountability and capabilities across our  global supply chain, including accountability for  the respect of human rights. Intel seeks to mitigate climate and water impacts, achieve efficiencies,  lower costs, and position ourselves to respond to  the expectations of our stakeholders. R&D investment is critical to enable us to deliver  on our accelerated process technology roadmap, introduce leading products, and develop new businesses and capabilities in the future. We own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products,  services, R&D, and other activities and assets. We also focus on  reducing our design complexity, reusing IP, and increasing ecosystem  collaboration to improve our efficiency. Intel ranked #10 in patents granted for 2023 by the US Patents and Trademark Office, our ninth straight year in the top 10. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and deter unau­ thorized use of our IP and other assets. IDM 2.0 combines three capabilities. First, we will continue to build  most of our products in our fabs. Second, we expect continued use  of third-party foundry capacity to manufacture a range of modular tiles on advanced process. Intel is building a world-class foundry business, which we expect will combine leading-edge packaging and process technology. Intel Capital, our global investment organization, invests  in companies shaping the future of cloud, devices, frontier, and silicon. We are expanding manufacturing capacity across multiple sites and geographies. In 2023, we added Poland  to our assembly and test expansion roadmap. These investments further our IDM 2.0 strategy and are expected to support a resilient semiconductor supply. In 2023, our factories delivered continuous support to our customers as  we ramped new process technologies and equipment for our products. We continue to work  across our supply chain to minimize disruptions, improve productivity,  and increase overall capacity and output to meet customer expectations. Our mission is to enable  product and process leadership, industry-leading total cost of ownership, and on-time and uninterrupted supply for our customers. Our manufacturing facilities are primarily used for silicon wafer facturing, assembling, testing, and manufacturing. Our supply ecosystem comprises thousands of suppliers globally. We operate in a  network of manufacturing facilities integrated as though they were one factory to provide the most flexible supply capacity. Our  new process technologies, when ready for high-volume manufacturing, are transferred from a central development fab to one or more of our manufacturing facilities. The network of factories and the development  fab collaborate to continue. Intel's human capital strategy is grounded in our belief that our people are fundamental to our success. Delivering on our IDM  2.0 strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and  retaining top talent across the world. We are committed to creating an  inclusive workplace where the world’s top talent can thrive. We believe that an inclusive culture is important for attracting, developing,  and retaining top talent.

We are funding projects in areas such as using technology to improve health and safety. We are committed to maintaining and improving systems and processes to avoid causing or contributing to adverse impacts on human rights in our own countries. We work to create  shared value through our RISE strategy. Intel has established an integrated approach to managing human rights across our business. This includes senior-level management involvement and board-level over­ sight. We actively manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality and achieve environmental and social goals. We invest in environmental  projects and set company-wide environmental targets to drive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water use, and waste generation. “Stakeholder Engagement” and “Supply Chain Responsibility” later in this section. Intel is committed to helping customers lower their own emissions, energy usage, and costs. We collaborate with policymakers and other stakeholders to use technology to address environmental challenges. We invest in our highly skilled  workforce of 124,800 people by creating practices, programs, and benefits that support the  evolving world of work. Having an integrated strategy and embedding corporate responsibility across the company is the most effective management approach. We have established cross-functional Management Review Committees (MRCs) of senior executives who are responsible for managing corpo­ rate responsibility and sustainability activities across the organization. Corporate Responsibility Office acts as an internal adviser to drive strategic alignment. Many Intel business groups have established  teams dedicated to corporate responsibility issues. Read more about the oversight and management of each area of corporate responsibility in each section of this report and on the Report Builder website. Since 2008, we have linked a portion of our executive and employee compensation to corporate responsibility factors in our Annual  Performance Bonus. In 2023, we included ESG metrics aligned with our  culture transformation and RISE goals, including the UN Global Compact and International Labour Standards. In 2024, we set new metrics in these same areas. employee experience,  inclusion, climate change, and water stewardship. Our integrated outreach team, led by our Investor Relations group,  Corporate Responsibility Office, Human Resources, and Corporate  Strategy Office, met with investors. Outreach efforts engaged approximately 49% of institutionally-held  shares. Virtual meeting focused on corporate responsibility,  environmental, and social matters engaged approximately 31% of our  institutionly-held shares. We believe that our approach to engaging  openly and year-round with our investors regarding ESG issues drives  increased increased shareholder interest. The feedback we receive through  our investor outreach activities is communicated to Intel’s Board of  Directors and relevant committees throughout the year. We integrate ESG information into our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, 2024 Proxy Statement, and Investor Relations website. Risk Management License to Operate and Governance.

In 2023, the Board worked closely with senior  management in evaluating and refining our AI strategy. The Board’s Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee (Governance Committee) has primary responsibility for the strategy and execution of “IDM 2.0” The Governance Committee is responsible for oversight of the company’s initiatives related to corporate responsibility and sustainability. Management provides formal updates to the governance Committee  at least twice each year, and at least annually to the board of directors. The Committee is also responsible for overseeing human capital issues and ethics and compliance program. In 2023, the committee retained a leading search firm to generate  candidate pools with diverse perspectives. The committee reviewed the 2022-2023 Corporate  Responsibility Report and updates on issues including environmental  sustainability, climate risk and transition action plan. The committee reviews the candidate pipeline  regularly. Such reviews resulted in the appointment in March 2024 of our newest director, Stacy J. Smith. Smith was initially recommended  to the committee by the retained independent search firm. A full interview with Stacy Smith will be broadcast on CNN at 10 p.m. ET on Thursday. Each year, our CEO communicates with our employees and managers about the importance of ethics and legal compliance. This ‘tone  from the top’ proliferated in  our corporate required annual ethics and compliance training, regular  communications. description of the Board’s responsibilities, skills, and experience are available in our 2024 Proxy Statement. ""We maintain a robust process for reporting misconduct, and our  policies encourage employees to raise questions and concerns,"" the company says. ""We  maintain multiple channels for employees and others to report concerns,"" it adds. The company also holds annual ethics and compliance summits,  and educational resources. Intel has a non-retaliation policy, which prohibits retaliation against anyone who, in  good faith, reports a concern or participates in an investigation. The anonymous reporting channel consists of an Integrity  Line through which anyone can report alleged misconduct via messag­ ing or an online reporting tool. Board and senior management receive periodic reports of statistics  related to misconduct, as well as details about key investigations. Our  Ethics and Compliance Business Champions encourage employees to  stay current with their ethics and compliance training, review verified  investigations quarterly with business group leaders, and raise employee awareness regarding how to report concerns. In 2024, for the 14th year,  Ethisphere Institute named Intel to  its annual list of the World’s Most  Ethical Companies. The Intel Code of Conduct was recently updated to reflect changes in the company. The Code affirms the principles intended to guide the behavior of employees,  subsidiaries, and members of our Board. Through the Code, which is available in 12 languages, we seek to promote honest and ethical  conduct, deter wrongdoing, and support. Employees are expected to complete annual online training. Intel executives also receive instructor-led training. The targeted employee population completes an annual disclosure process to monitor compliance with the Code. Depending on the situation, Intel may have to change its code of conduct. In 2023, approximately 99%  of our employees completed ethics and legal compliance training  (Code of Conduct training, anti-corruption, and antitrust awareness) Over 99% received training on information security and privacy  awareness (including Intel) About 99% of assigned employees completed  harassment avoidance training. Over 99% completed Safety Always training. Intel works with governments, organizations, and industries around the world to advocate for policies that encourage new ideas, promote fair commerce, and protect. We work to make our priorities and positions on key issues clear by including information on our Public Policy website, publicly supporting  amicus briefs, or submitting testimony. We also work to educate political  candidates about the implications of public policy decisions for our business. In the US, we provide financial support to candidates who hold positions consistent with our business objectives. Intel’s global social equity principles guide our work with governments  and organizations to build a more equitable world. The principles aim to combat systemic inequities impacting employees and communities globally. Included are regulation and policies in the areas of economic, R&D, tax  policy, cybersecurity and more.

Decisions  on political contributions, whether from the Intel Political Action Committee (IPAC) or corporate funds, consider Intel’s business  objectives, corporate policies, and the public policy priorities outlined on ballot propositions. We publish reports on our corporate contributions, IPAC contributions,  and trade association membership dues on our Report Builder website. our Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility websites. We continued our commitment to the Digital Climate Alliance, a first-of-its-kind coalition of  leading global companies. The alliance’s agenda focuses on building the policy infrastructure needed to ensure that the digital age enables the large-scale societal transformations needed to build a climate-safe and equitable world. Specifically, the alliance addresses how digital solutions could help reduce  global carbon emissions. Intel makes relatively few direct  political contributions using corporate funds. Intel has a policy of  not making independent political political contributions. The company uses real-time, verifiable data to turn carbon transparency into market-driven climate action; and enhance business resiliency in the face of resource scarcity. IPAC’s approach targets  balanced support of Democrat and Republican candidates each cycle. All  employee participation in IPAC is voluntary. We disclose trade association membership dues and payments to other tax-exempt organizations such as 501(c)(4) and 501 (c)(6) Intel files quarterly reports with the Secretary of  the US Senate and the Clerk of the US House of Representatives that detail our lobbying activities. These reports can be found in the Senate’s  Lobbying Disclosure Act Database. We also publish updated lobbying  expenditures on our external Report Builder website annually. Decisions are to be made based on states and districts with a significant Intel presence and leadership on committees of jurisdiction on important Intel priorities. In response to stakeholder feedback, we have further enhanced our  review process by adding reviews of public statements to better assess alignment with our values.

Intel engages a third-party specialist to conduct a comprehensive Corporate Responsibility priority assessment every two years. This assessment is designed to allow us to identify and prioritize  the ESG issues that are of greatest concern to our stakeholders and that impact the success of Intel. We review  industry best practices and reports, external reporting standards, and  new and emerging ESG legislation. We also engage multiple internal  ESG experts across the business. We conduct external outreach to gain  additional external perspectives from governments, NGOs, investors, stockholders, customers, and peer companies. The Intel Corporate Responsibility Priority Matrix plots material ESG issues based on their current or potential relevance. Issues and themes in each cell  are listed in alphabetical order. Issues are assigned singly as  “Environmental,” “Social,’ or “Economic” We recognize that many ESG subjects and themes are multi-faceted and intersectional in nature. It is important to note that everything included  within the Corporate Responsibility Priority Matrix is of importance to Intel. The issues and themes listed in the matrix were prioritized from  multiple topics. Human rights are the fundamental rights, freedoms, and standards  of treatment to which all people are entitled.

Intel does not support or tolerate our products being used to adversely impact  human rights. We evaluate potential concerns and implement a high  confidence standard to prevent and address them. We do not always know nor can we control what products our  customers create or the applications end users may develop. In 2023, while certain product sales to third-party entities met Intel’s  high-confidence human rights standards, we continued to restrict other product sales. mitigate product misuse. Where  we become aware of a concern that Intel products are being used by  a business partner in connection with abuses of human rights, we will  restrict or cease business with the third party. Intel has implemented a ‘High Confidence Standard’ based on the Intel Global Human Rights Principles and Approach. We continue to leverage the UN Guiding Principles  on Business and Human Rights and due diligence standards under the  laws and regulations that apply to our business in the US.

Key progress included adding a “Protect the Environment’ principle, launching  new internal and academic research, and increasing focus on AI safety. We have long engaged directly with our suppliers to engage in critical new  multi-stakeholder initiatives. Our RISE goals have significantly expanded the number of suppliers covered by our engagement activities to drive deeper  accountability for human rights throughout our global supply chain. We are also leading technology industry initiatives to further advance  responsible practices in minerals sourcing, mobility, and AI. We apply our expertise and resources to further enable others to harness  the power of technology to improve health, safety, and well-being. This  includes working with the healthcare industry to accelerate critical  research and improve healthcare access and affordability. We also apply  technology to build smart and safer workplaces and factories to reduce  injuries. We intend to continue to take actions to deepen our focus on maintaining and building a robust safety culture as  our business changes and grows. 2030 RISE: Responsible Goals,  Initiatives, and Global Challenges Global Challenge: Revolutionize health and safety through. Technology Industry Initiatives: Responsible Minerals. Expand our efforts beyond conflict minerals1 to cover all minerals used in semiconductor manufacturing. Responsible Mobility. Collaborate with our industry and ecosystem  peers to advance the adoption of technology-neutral safety standards. Scale supplier responsibility programs to ensure respect for human rights across 100% of our  contracted suppliers and all high-risk-identified suppliers in the  supply chain. Ensure that more than 90%  of our employees believe that Intel has a strong safety culture. 50% participate in our global corporate wellness program. Intel invests in health, safety, and wellness programs to  help employees enjoy a better quality of life and contribute to Intel’s  success. Our Global Environmental, Health, and Safety Policy defines  our commitment to provide  environmental, health, and safety protections. Since 2001, we have maintained a multi-site certification to  the internationally recognized ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 standards. We  recognize the importance of EHS management to our business success and regularly work to assess and improve our EHS system. In 2023, independent third-party audits  were conducted to maintain this certification. sustain a comprehensive, fully integrated EHS management system. As we expand manufacturing operations in support of Intel’s IDM  2.0 strategy, we intend to continue to implement world-class EHS programs. Intel's training system is designed to help employees understand their safety responsibilities. Health and safety training creates awareness and enables employees to better understand their responsibilities. Advancing accountability and improving performance across our supply chain creates value for Intel and our customers. For more information, see “Supply Chain Responsibility” in the Our  Business section of this report. Intel employees are required to complete designated EHS training, as relevant to their roles. EHS courses are  provided in different languages, and include web-based, instructor- led, virtual and augmented reality, and on-the-job training. In 2023, more than 370,500 such  training will be provided. In 2023, our manufacturing, supply chain, and technology development  organizations continued quarterly, trackable manager Safety TALKs. We also refreshed our 2023 Safety Always training  course using updated training methodologies. To boost safety aware­ ness across the company, this training continues to be assigned to employees. All new non-factory employees are required to complete office ergonomics training. 98% of our workforce completed it in 2023. Ergo+ concierge provides one-on-one advice and one-to-one support. In 2023, over 19,000 employees engaged in the program. Individual organizations additionally targeted a 25%  engagement rate, and a number of business groups exceeding 30% engagement of employees. Employees can initiate these services via an online tool. In 2023, we held  in-person events at multiple sites, as well as virtual engagements with  business leaders and experts. Break compliance improved  from 91% to 92% for those participating during 2023. In addition, we continue to expand our year-round multimedia  Safety Always employee awareness campaign. Intel ended 2023 with an OSHA recordable rate of 0.83 per 100 employees. The campaign included interactive learning games on safety, as well as regular, widely  read employee communications on topics such as traffic safety, ergonomics, and improving safety culture. Ergonomic-related or cumulative trauma dis­ orders (CTDs) remained the most prevalent type of injury experienced at Intel in 2023, accounting for 61% of all reports. Office Ergonomics Program’s early intervention focus is  starting to have an impact, with a 15% reduction in office CTD rates compared to 2022. In 2023, 98% of our workforce  completed our Safety Always training course. integrate learnings into our 2024  ergonomics program’s early intervention focus plans. In 2023-24 Intel Corporate Responsibility Report  43 Intel’S global wellness program, known as the Intel® Vitality Program, supports our RISE goals. Intel Vitality Program offers livestream and on-demand fitness classes, wellness coach consultations, and nutrition seminars. Utilization of on-site  fitness services increased in 2023, with a total of 42,409 unique users, as more employees returned to working at Intel facilities. As part of our  RISE program, we offer a self-guided learning series offered through the Exos Fit app. In 2023, we offered  more than 100,000 Intel Vitality sessions, with a total of over 550,000  participants. Participants  reported a 94% satisfaction rating with the program. The global wellness  program continued offering access to the Headspace meditation application, with 26,000 enrolled members. Almost 10,000 employees used Headspace  an average of 12 sessions per month. In 2023, Headspace will provide. access to employee dependents starting in October 2023. The program aims to create a culture of care where employees feel  empowered to take the next step in their mental health journey. Intel hosted World Mental Health Day in recognition of the day. The company has expanded access to its digital mental wellness platform in 48 countries. Intel has continued to support its employees through stressful world events through group support sessions, enhanced 1:1 access, in-person therapy opportunities, and more. Wellness Month focused on four pillars of well-being. Webinars, mindfulness  breaks, movement sessions, and events led by industry experts. Two  executives from Intel’s leadership team shared their personal experiences in nurturing their mental health. Each Safety Star is passionate about  maintaining our strong safety culture, serves as a role model, and goes above and beyond to make Intel a safe place. During  Global Safety Day in April, the honorees were recognized  individually or as part of a team. The COHE app replaces the paper-based auditing system with a digital app that includes features such as image capture, comments, and best-known methods. The app is designed to follow the COHE standard and allows for real-time data recording, making it easier to use. The app has been in use   since late 2021 and has successfully conducted over 500 audits. It has been useful for training new COHE auditors and has received  positive feedback from both new recruits and experienced auditors. The app has also been used to perform proactive audits with Intel  supplier groups to ensure they meet COHE standards. The apps have been widely used in Intel’s LTD Sort Test department and other groups. The apps can be easily accessed using Intel-provided cell phones. The success of one of the apps  in LTD led to its adoption by Intel's Aloha, Oregon Fab Operations. Intel has close to 35 on-site health clinics to address work- related employee health and safety needs. At our sites in the U.S. tools enhance safety awareness and documentation, which has resulted in improved safety outcomes across multiple Intel factories. In 2023, the Health for Life Centers administered  hundreds of flu shots and COVID-19 vaccinations, and delivered  approximately 14,000 virtual visits. In Arizona, New  Mexico, and Oregon, we also have Health for life Centers to provide  primary care and specialty services. Intel aims to ensure 90% of employees believe Intel has a strong safety culture. The company also wants to achieve 50% participation in our global corporate wellness program. At the start of 2020, 37% of Intel employees (primarily in our manufacturing operations) had the opportunity to provide feed­ back in our EHS Safety Culture Survey. Intel's health, safety, and wellness teams took  steps to identify effective ways to expand the number of employees  who have the opportunity to participate in the safety culture survey. Based on Intel restructuring actions, the safety and wellness culture surveys were conducted. 87% of employees from  organizations that engaged in the survey process in 2022 reported that “safety is a value.” The Intel Vitality Program continued to reach 90% of  Intel’s employee population. paused in 2023 with a plan to restart in 2024. 41% of Intel employees participated in Intel’s wellness services in 2023. We intend to work toward company-wide  participation in our safety culture survey. We also intend to further expand wellness program access to our global  employee population over the next two years. Intel plans to increase the  annual participation rate for global employees to 50%. Industry benchmarking indicates that general corporate wellness program  participation rates are about 20-40%. Intel participation is measured by the  percentage of employees engaging in the program during the calendar year. Intel's commitment to respect human rights is a continuous process that requires us to regularly engage with, listen to, and learn from all Intel stakeholders. We meet with internal and external stakeholders to identify, assess, prevent, and  mitigate adverse human rights impacts associated with our operations. We recognize that some people may be at  greater risk of adverse human rights impacts due to their vulnerability or marginalization. Women, children, persons with disabilities, migrant workers, and human rights defenders are among those at greater risk. We expect our suppliers and their suppliers to comply with the Intel Human Rights Principles and Approach. The RBA Code describes industry-wide human  rights, health and safety, environmental, and ethical standards. It is consistent with the Intel Global Human Rights Principles and  Approach, the Intel Statement on Combating Modern Slavery, the ILO Core Conventions, and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Every year we complete the RBA Self-Assessment Questionnaire and publish the results on our corporate website. In 2023, we conducted an RBA audit  of our manufacturing operations in Costa Rica, earning full marks of  200/200. We also conducted an audit of our Penang, Malaysia oper­ ations earning 175.4/200 and the R BA’s Silver Recognition. Intel's processes are designed to regularly evaluate, verify, and address  risks in our supply chain. An audit of our Chengdu, China operations is scheduled  for 2024. address any confirmed findings through a closure audit at the Penang  site in 2024. Intel. begin assessing suppliers for  risk and conducting due diligence. Suppliers that want to do business with Intel are expected to complete a corporate social responsibility survey. Most enter into contracts that require suppliers to strictly comply with  Intel policies and applicable local laws and regulations. Critical and high-risk suppliers must complete a questionnaire to determine a facility’s potential gaps to the RBA Code. Self-assessments are then evaluated for human rights, health and safety,  environmental, and ethical factors. Intel reminds suppliers of their legal obligations to comply with Intel policies. We strive to audit 100% of major suppliers and high-risk supplier  sites within a two-year cycle. Additional suppliers may be audited at our  discretion. In 2023, we conducted 17 audits for suppliers deeper within  our supply chain. The audit standard we utilize throughout our supply chain is the RBA Code of Conduct. The code has expectations in the areas of human rights, health  and safety, environmental ethics, and management systems. We are committed to respecting human rights. Both audit types follow the R BA VAP standard and help us identify where immediate action is needed. When auditors uncover findings, our policies require suppliers to draft comprehensive corrective action plans. everywhere Intel does business. We work closely with the suppliers to document  actions taken to remedy the findings. We then monitor their progress until the issues are resolved. In 2023, 67% of the combined RBA audits were follow-up or closure audits. What we learn from audits helps inform our supplier engagement, capability-building programs, and future audit plans. We have instituted a process of unannounced audits to follow up on  credible reports of non-compliance. “Critical suppliers” represent a subset of all first-tier suppliers with which we have  significant relationships and spends. “High/er risk suppliers’ refers to any suppliers  deemed above average risk, based on data  and supplier performance. If a supplier does not make sufficient  progress in addressing audit findings or has particularly egregious  issues, we seek to work with the supplier to swiftly implement a Targeted  Action Plan. Supplier progress is reviewed quarterly until we have  verified that key issues have been closed. If satisfactory  progress is not made, we may take additional action, such as not  awarding new business (“conditional use” status) Intel works to close egregious issues within 30 days. At the end of 2023, we did not have any suppliers. issues are  resolved or—when necessary—ending the supplier relationship. While  complete closure of some issues can take several years. Intel has established formal grievance and remedy processes that enable anyone to report ethics, human rights, compliance, or safety concerns. Once received, reports concerning alleged  human rights impacts within the supply chain are received. Intel Integrity Line Ethics and  Compliance Reporting Portal. on Targeted Action Plans. Intel does not tolerate retaliation against anyone who in good faith reports possible  violations of the law, Intel’s Code of Conduct, or other policies. managed by a cross  functional multi-disciplinary team, which promptly investigates allegations and takes measures to mitigate any adverse impacts. In 2023, 263 audits were conducted across 161 suppliers. Over 520 supplier sites had received RBA VAP, RBA SVAP, or RBA-Based Target audits by the end of 2023. Audits that were planned in 2023 but not executed and still deemed necessary are included in our 2024 plan. We treat each individual audit of a single facility as a unique audit in the above table. Findings That May Trigger Forced and Bonded Labor Risks Findings 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Closed 40 30 52 76 13 In Process – – 1 3 61 Total 40 30 53 79 74 Intel has worked to build a strong system to detect and address risks of forced and bonded labor. Intel’s policy is to request an audit when we detect a higher  risk to the human rights of workers or a non-conformance to any of our expectations. Intel Statement on Combating Modern Slavery details the  expectations we have for ourselves and for our suppliers. Intel prohibits holding worker passports and charging workers for their services. The Intel Statement also details  prohibitions against holding worker passport and charging worker services. Since 2014, our suppliers have returned more than $27 million in fees to more than 28,000 of their workers. Fees returned typically equate to  approximately three to five months of base pay, depending on location and situation. In some instances, we have faced. workers fees  to obtain or keep employment. Intel co-founded and serves on the working group of the multi-industry,  multi-stakeholder Responsible Labor. We strive to work  closely with suppliers to determine acceptable remedies and put systems in place to prevent such issues in the future. In 2023, Intel co-sponsored virtual workshop-style training sessions,  “Mandatory Human Rights Due Diligence Legislation,” which were facilitated by the RBA. We expect to  continue to co-sponsor these trainings in 2024. 2030 Goal: Supply Chain Human Rights. At the beginning of 2020, 18% of our contracted suppliers  had been assessed and engaged in our supplier responsibility  programs. By the end of the year, 8% had completed the requirements of the goal. In 2023, the language for this goal was updated to reflect Intel’s continued commitment to human rights for all. In 2023, we reached 25%, through audits, validated third-party assessments, and attestation for lower-risk contracted suppliers. In 2024, we aim to maintain our progress and  continue to evaluate the impact of IDM 2.0 supply chain changes. 100% of our  contracted suppliers and all  high risk-identified suppliers  in the supply chain by 2030. Conduct human rights due  diligence in accordance with the  UN Guiding Principles on Business  and Human Rights and OECD Guidelines for Multinational  Enterprises. Since 2014 we have  returned $27M in fees to over  28,000 workers in our global supply chain. 1,669 audits with  6,059 findings  closed since 2011. We have conducted human  rights due diligence. and mitigate adverse  human rights impacts. Intel and its suppliers use minerals in manufacturing. In 2008, Intel began work to responsibly  source conflict minerals. In 2017, we expanded our efforts to also  address cobalt in our supply chain. We are proud of the significant  progress we have made as a company. Intel’s strategy is to maintain the positive progress we’ve made to date on 3TG (tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold) and cobalt. Our ambition is to proactively address emerging risks from the expanding scope of materials and  geographies. Responsible Minerals program, Responsible Mineral Sourcing Policy,  and due diligence practices are designed to address minerals originating in CAHRAs. More information is available on our Responsible Mineralals website. apply our learnings from over a decade  and work with the electronics industry to broaden and accelerate the creation of sourcing standards for a much wider set of minerals. In 2023, we sought sourcing information for what we deem critical minerals. This represented an important step in our RISE strategy, as we begin  mapping our supply chain for our highest-risk materials. The materials include aluminum, copper, nickel, and zinc. Intel is one of the first companies to require the sourcing information on these minerals. We received a response from approximately 90% of the  in-scope suppliers. We are continuing to pursue information on smelters  and refiners in our extended supply chain. Intel is an active member of The Copper Mark, including participating in its Risk Readiness Assessment Technical Revision Committee. To support the uptake of transparency and responsible  practices in large-scale mining across all other minerals that we source,  Intel joined. Intel serves as co-leader of the Emerging Minerals  Working Group within the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) Intel’s responsible 3TG and cobalt program, aligned with the OECD Guidance, focuses on three primary areas: Risk Identification. Each year we conduct a supply chain survey to identify the smelters and refiners that process the 3 TG and Cobalt. Intel conducts due diligence to identify potential mineral supply chain risks. Due diligence may include on-site smelter or refiner visits. Intel uses RMI’s Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) to identify risks. In 2023, Intel led in-person outreach to over 12 smelters in Indonesia to encourage and support RMAP participation. When necessary, we may disengage from mineral supply chains that cannot uphold our responsible minerals sourcing standards. Such visits or virtual outreach help identify risks and drive risk mitigation. 99% of smelters and refiners reported in our supply chain are deemed responsibly sourced. “Conflict minerals,” as defined by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is  a broad term that means tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold. CAHRAs are identified by the presence of armed conflict,  widespread violence, or other risks of harm to people. Armed conflict may take a variety of forms, such as a conflict of international or non-international character. High-risk areas may include areas of political instability or repression, institutional  weakness, insecurity, collapse of countries. Intel's goal is to responsibly source all cobalt in our products. Intel used  the RMI Extended Minerals Reporting Template to survey the suppliers contributing cobalt. In 2023, we received responses  from 100% of suppliers surveyed. We are working to have all refiners in our  cobalt supply chain participate in RMAP. We believe that the creation and  support of responsibly sourced3 minerals from CAHRAs improve  the lives of the people in CAHRA. Intel is a member of the Public-  Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA) and European Partnership for Responsibility Minerals (EPRM) Intel’s long-term leadership in initiatives such as the RMI and PPA allows us to support regional projects that enable responsibly sourced minerals from CAHRAs. In 2024, we will. regularly collaborate on the issue of responsible minerals  sourcing with other companies, industries, governments, and civil  society. Such collaboration is crucial to identify and address risks  associated with mineral extraction and trade in complex mineral supply chains. We plan to continue to work with industry  associations to confirm that standards are in place. “Responsibly sourced” refers to products from suppliers, supply chains, smelters, and  refiners that, based on our due diligence, have been identified as high priority minerals. “Conflict minerals disclosure filed with the US Securities  and Exchange Commission contains additional information about  our 3TG and cobalt due diligence practices. Intel believes in direct engagement with mining communities to elevate the perspectives of rights holders, address human rights issues, and effect positive change. Intel’s mineral supply chain due diligence activities are critical for both enabling compliance and achieving our RISE goals. Intel is supporting projects in Congo to provide clean power to mining areas. RMI-Pact Youth Vocational Training Program aims to provide livelihood alternatives to Congolese youth engaged in mining. Intel is also working with expert civil  society organizations to help identify and remedy the challenges of the mining communities that source our products. Intel believes in the  local socio-economic importance of the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector in CAHRAs. We are supporters of a sustainable development project  focusing on ASM copper mining in Peru led by The Copper Mark and  Alliance for Responsible Mining. Intel supports Esawa, a digital suite of data collection tools that include miner incentives. Designed specifically for the ASM sector, Esawa is expected to create new pathways to track, access, and share data about practices in mining communities. Maintaining a connection  and providing support to the communities that we depend on in our  vast global supply chain is a crucial component to our responsible minerals program. Intel entered the market for automotive engine controllers in 1976. Now,  Intel’s responsible mobility RISE technology initiative focuses on collab­ orating with industry, ecosystem peers, and governments to advance  automotive safety and sustainability globally. In 2023, Intel advanced responsible mobility by continuing to  contribute to standards that improve road safety for automated vehicles. In support of this vision, Intel  has worked alongside the industry to solve its toughest challenges in the pivot toward a future that is software-defined and sustainable. Intel and SAE International announce a committee to deliver an automotive standard for Vehicle Platform Power Management (J3311) Intel will chair the committee. Software-Defined Vehicles. sustainable SDVs,  Intel and Sae International announced. The IT. industry long ago moved away from embedded single-function devices and migrated to modern,  high-performance computing systems. The results have been significant cost and  performance efficiency benefits. Since modern software-defined systems were introduced in the IT industry more  than 20 years ago, IT and other industries have embraced them. Intel Automotive has committed to an open  software architecture for vehicles. Customers can use Intel Foundry to integrate their own custom chiplet into a standard Intel Automotive roadmap product. As the only automotive industry supplier offering such a capability, Intel is underscoring its commitment to automotive open platforms for both hardware and software. Many modern EV architectures are based on traditional vehicle designs that used internal combustion engines. Often these EV designs include less-energy-efficient multi-cell batteries similar to those used in laptops in the mid-1990s. With up to 100 electronic control units (ECUs) in today’s vehicles,  the cumulative energy usage keeps growing. As the  industry advances, there is a need for a power management standard. Intel pioneered the  Advanced Configuration and Power Interface specification for laptops in the mid 1990s. In the same way Intel is committed to bringing better power management for internal combustion engine vehicles. Mobileye’s Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model can enable safe, commercial deployment of automated vehicles at scale, anywhere in the world. RSS formalizes decision  making for safe driving and is based on the need to balance safety and convenience. Intel led an IEEE standards working group to define an open,  transparent, and technology-neutral standard for safe decision  making in automated driving. The output of this working group,  known as IEEE 2846, is known as RSS. RSS provides regulators around the world a transparent way to evaluate the safety performance of driverless vehicles. IEEE 2846 received the 2022 IEEE Standard  Association Emerging Technology Award. Assumptions in Safety-Related Models for  Automated Driving Systems, was the first international standard that provides guidance on what constitutes expected safe behavior of automated driving systems. In 2023, Intel continued to participate in developing standardization guidelines. Mobileye completed an initial public offering in October 2022. Intel remains the  majority stockholder and continues to be involved in the development of the technology. The company continues to work with the European Commission to develop new standards for automated driving. Intel Corp. consolidate the results of Mobileye into its  consolidated financial statements. Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming how we live and work. It is helping save lives through early cancer detection, giving people with visual impairments  new ways to see, restoring and maximizing agricultural crop health. Intel’s  focused work on responsible AI (RAI) began in 2017 and has evolved to include structured, rigorous, multidisciplinary processes. We believe in the potential of AI technology to create positive global  change, empower people with the right tools, and improve the life of every person on the planet. Intel's goal is to support all AI models,  including generative AI, with responsible perspectives and principles. We remain  committed to implementing leading processes founded on international  standards and industry best practice, aligned with the rapidly evolving  global AI regulatory landscape. We saw rapid advancement in AI innovation in 2023, with generative  AI technology at the forefront. Intel’s Trusted Media team  works to build generative AI applications with humans in mind. In 2023, we shared additional details publicly about our RAI strategy,  which is centered along four pillars that represent what we consider  the most effective ways to use AI. Intel aims to leverage its place in the AI value  chain, help drive meaningful progress, and scale these efforts broadly. Members of our multidisciplinary Responsible AI Advisory Council (RAI  Council) are responsible for conducting a rigorous review throughout  the lifecycle of an AI project. The RAI Council has a diverse composition  that brings a balanced and balanced view of AI. In 2023, we engaged with diverse business groups and improved our  processes to make it easier and more efficient for development teams to engage with the RAI Council. We also started working with our supply  chain responsibility organization to accelerate progress in addressing  the human rights of global AI data enrichment. RAI Council members provide training, feedback, and support to our  development teams and business units to provide for consistency and  compliance to our principles across Intel. We continue to continue to support  workers who perform tasks such as data annotation, data cleaning, and human review  of algorithmic outputs. The RAI Council’s internal work is based on seven principles:   Respect Human Rights: Development, use, and implementation of AI should proactively contemplate and respect the human rights of all relevant rights holders. evolve our  thinking and approach, and iterate based on insights from key learnings. To enable human controls throughout the  life cycle of an AI system, the needs of various stakeholders should be supported. Developers should seek to train AI systems with the ap­ propriate feedback and oversight. Users and interested parties should assess the outputs of these systems and be able to assess them. Developers should strive to provide comprehensive information. This includes: recommended uses, potential harms, and best possible explanations of system behavior for all stakeholders. documentation detailing how  AI systems were trained and tested. information on training sets and  the results of bias testing. Intel prioritizes security,  safety, resistance to tampering and reliability in the development of AI  products. We strive to limit the application of Intel AI products to their  intended use. Intel utilizes “security by design” development principles consistent with our Security First Pledge.  AI applications utilize large amounts of data, so respecting the privacy and security of personal information must  be prioritized. Intel supports  privacy rights by designing our technology with those rights in  mind, including being transparent about the need for any personal data collection. Intel is committed to building inclusivity into every  step in the value chain. designing,  developing, and deploying our products with appropriate guardrails  to protect personal data. Intel strives to look at all aspects of AI with an inclusion lens. Intel strives to develop,  deploy, and use AI consistent with Intel’s environmental stewardship commitments. We take action to mitigate potential biases and communicate with stakeholders to  make it easier for them to do the same. AI can consume significant amounts of  energy and require substantial use of materials. Intel is focusing on hardware and software development that accelerates the transition toward a low- carbon, low-waste future. As part of the Intel® Digital Readiness program, in 2023, we launched our first 16-week/64-hour “Applied Ethics for AI” and “AI for  Sustainability” course curriculum. We continue to collaborate with academic organizations across the world to conduct research in key areas where we believe we can have the greatest impact. We also debuted the Digital Trust for  All program with Miami-Dade College to educate users on cybersecurity  principles and digital responsibility. In 2023, we launched new internal and academic research focused on  several RAI priorities, including safety, trusted media, and environmental  sustainability. Safety Working Group,  AI Alliance, Partnership on AI work groups, Roundtable on Human  Rights and AI, and other multi-stakeholder initiatives. Machine learning developers should be empowered to decarbonize their work. This effort will help solve the current gap between corporate  net-zero goals and the immediate incentives that AI researchers and  developers experience. Another research project is looking at “grid-adaptive” AI training,  recommendations about resource utilization. Intel is collaborating with Dr. Umur Ciftci from Binghamton University on this research. The research has shown promising results to date, with accuracy  rates ranging from 92-99%. For more details, read this paper. Additional  research collaborations include My Face My Choice, which enables users to choose their own face. My Art My Choice combats GenAI that leverages artwork not authorized by creators. My Face My Choice goes well beyond current tagging systems and replaces unapproved faces in photos with quantitatively dissimilar deepfakes. Intel and Georgia Tech have been leading DARPA’s Guaranteeing AI  Robustness Against Deception. The program challenged performers to design  mitigations against AI system vulnerabilities like evasion and poisoning attacks. We showed that these vulnerabilities exist in the real world and improved the methodology for understanding them by using  simulation. We delivered several innovative solutions to help train a  model with adversarial examples to improve its robustness and  resilience against evasion attacks. We showed these solutions at Intel Vision and  Innovation 2023 events. We also open-sourced a modular adversarial  robustness toolkit. In addition, we established the Intel Center of Excellence on Responsible  Human-AI Systems (RESUMAIS)  RESUMAIS aims to foster the ethical and  user-centric development of AI. It focuses on issues such as fairness,  human/AI collaboration, accountability, and transparency. It is a collaboration of four leading research institutions, including three in Germany. Intel is involved in a number of key areas of AI, including work with the AI Alliance and MIT's AI Lab. Intel is also involved with the National Science Foundation and the Information Technology Industry Council. The company is also working with the MLCommons® AI Safety Working Group. We develop platforms and solutions to make responsible AI pragmatic and manageable for developers. We create software tools to ease the  burden of responsible AI development and use. Intel Corporate Responsibility Report: 2023-24 Intel corporate responsibility report:  53 Products and Solutions. In 2023, we released new open source explainability tools like Model Card  Generator. We believe in  inclusive AI to improve privacy, security, and transparency and to reduce bias. We do this by conducting ethnographic research to understand pain points and how to address those appropriately. There is a need for equity, inclusion, and cultural sensitivity in the development and deployment of AI. We strive to ensure that the  teams working on these technologies are diverse and inclusive. We are  involved in multiple efforts aimed at creating inclusive AI. Intel has released new AI content to promote skills development across traditional industry sectors. We strive to be transparent about our position and practices so we can address shared challenges and improve our products and the overall industry. We continue our active engagement in forums. Intel Fellow Lama Nachman has led Intel’s RAI work since its inception. She and her team of researchers are working on  optimizing human-AI collaboration. Learn about her perspectives  on RAI by reading this editorial. “We are focused on human AI  collaboration and the relentless pursuit  of developing human-AI systems that amplify human potential, forging a  brighter path for how we live, work, and  learn. AI should really be in service  of humanity.” —Intel Fellow Lama Nachman. We participate in the development of international standards to advancing AI technology responsibly. Some examples include The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), focusing on addressing content ownership online. We also work with the Confidential Computing Consortium, focused on securing and  enhancing privacy of data in use. International standardization efforts such as those under ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 42 serve an important role in supporting  global AI policies. We are also contributing to initiatives led by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) In 2023, we advanced our work to revolutionize health and safety through technology by participating in innovative collaborations. We also deepened our engagement around AI safety and invested in the AI Risk Management Framework, which informs US practices and advances global standards efforts. Cancer research is one of the most impactful uses for AI today. Bringing AI-driven research to scale is difficult due to patient data confidentiality. In 2023, Intel Labs continued to collaborate with a leading medical university to devise a novel solution with the help of federated learning. Intel's OpenFL project enables anyone to deploy their own FL project. Using this model, organizations gain the value of patient data without compromising privacy. The result: a 33% improvement, up from  30% in 2022, in brain tumor detection based on MRI scans from more  than 6,300 patients. Intel joined with MLCommons’ MedPerf to build a platform that was launched in 2023. “I am honored to be working alongside medical AI researchers. Seeing  our technology empower their efforts toward the common good excites  me for the future of federated learning,” says Micah Sheller, Intel Labs’  Senior Researcher. Intel, FarEasTone Telecom and Taiwan-based hospitals develop app to recognize signs of laryngeal cancer. A patient vocalizes for two to three seconds into the app on a smartphone, and then AI, in combination with Intel-based hardware and software, compares the voice against scores. The diagnostic results are returned seconds after the voice has been recorded. All data is anonymized to preserve patient privacy. The  AI used is built on 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors, FPGA  accelerators, and two open-source software tools.  marginalized communities are often disproportionately impacted by disparities in  healthcare. In 2023, Intel, healthcare  solutions provider Henry Schein, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of  Minnesota collaborated to enhance healthcare access by $1.5 million. The goal is to improve access to primary, dental, mental, maternal, and other forms of healthcare. The solution integrates next-generation decision support enriched by AI and machine learning, enhanced diagnostics, and the data analytics necessary to enable precise decision-making. Results of similar telediagnostic pilot  programs show incredible promise, with a greater than 86% reduction in  emergency room visits and 50% faster access to care. The Pediatric Moonshot aims to address the pressing issue of  healthcare inequity for children worldwide. The concept is simple  yet transformative: Connect 1 million medical machines across 500  children’s hospitals globally, enabling clinical experts to reach patients. In 2023, Intel began making this vision a reality. In collaboration with  Dr. Chou, Intel’s Health Solutions Team provided the tools necessary to support privacy-preserving compression, communication, and viewing of medical data. Subsequent  stages in the Moonshot will explore how FL can train diagnostic AI models. Intel has long recognized the importance of the  ethical and human rights implications associated with the development  of technology, especially AI. In 2023, Intel will work to improve health  outcomes for children around the globe. diseases in underrepresented populations. Intel joined the MLCommons AI  Safety Working Group, a team of leading AI industry and academia experts. Intel will contribute its expertise and knowledge to help create benchmarks that measure the safety and risk factors of AI tools and models. In December 2023,  Intel Capital, Intel’s global investment organization, led a $10 million investment in a workplace safety startup. TuMeke is a computer vision platform that automatically assesses injury risk in manufacturing facilities. Using  TuMeke, safety staff can take a video on their smartphone and then reduce the identified risk of a job in minutes. The solution’s AI system combines the best in computer vision and ergonomics to help users redesign jobs or retrain workers. Diversity, equity, and inclusion have long been Intel’s core values. They are instrumental to driving innovation and delivering strong business growth. We are advancing diversity, equity and accessibility in our global workforce. We advocate for public policies and laws that address discrimination and inequities. We are intensifying  actions to advance our RISE goals, which, in line with market availability, include increasing the number of women and underrepresented minorities in senior leadership. Our aim is to continue to expand opportunities for our  employees and the industry through technology. Intel earned a top score of 100 on the Disability Equality Index by Disability:In and the American Association of People with Disabilities. The recognition also named Intel one of the best places to  work for disability inclusion. Intel has 27,000+ Employee Resource Group, Leadership Council, and Affinity Group members. In 2023, ERGs held 889 events, with an average satisfaction rating of 96%. Approximately  1,500 Intel leaders on eight Leadership Councils serve as role models. 20% Intel Capital investments in diverse start-ups Intel Capital, our venture. 20% of Intel's 2023 venture stage dollars committed to technology start-ups led by diverse leaders. Intel has taken actions to integrate diversity  and inclusion expectations into our culture, performance management  systems, leadership expectations, and annual bonus metrics. Since 2019, we have achieved gender pay equity globally and transparently report our representation and pay equity data. We hold ourselves, our people, our  leaders, and the industries we lead to high standards by creating an  inclusive culture and advancing diversity and inclusion in the industry and beyond. Intel's RISE strategy and goals set our global ambitions for where we  want our company to be in 2030. We intend to continue to advance  inclusion in our workforce using a holistic approach toward representa­ tion, pay equity, and strengthening our inclusive and accessible culture. In 2023, we changed the way that we reflect our inclusive  workforce goals by focusing on percentages rather than absolute numbers. This update  strengthens our commitment to industry best practices and helps  us continue to advance our workforce representation. Just as we value diversity and inclusion to foster innovation within Intel,  our commitment is to ensure that all employees have the opportunity to reach their potential. Our  RISE goals include increasing our annual spending with diverse-owned suppliers to $2 billion by 2030. We also work with others to expand and enable inclusive sourcing  practices across the industry. We know that today's greatest challenges  require a shared commitment to a plan and meaningful action. Alliance for Global Inclusion launched in 2021 with the goal of creating and implementing an Inclusion Index with unified goals and metrics. The Alliance is making a difference by document­ ing diversity, equity, and inclusion trends and  best practices on a global basis. RISE: Inclusive Goals, Initiatives, and Global Challenges Global Challenge: Make technology fully inclusive and expand digital readiness. Technology Industry Initiatives: Inclusion Index. Inclusive Pipeline. Expand the inclusive pipeline of talent for our industry. Achieve 5% representation of Black/African American employees in senior, director,  and executive roles in the US.

Achieve 10% representation of employees with  a disability in our global workforce by 2030. Increase global annual spending with diverse suppliers by 100% (to $2 billion) Ensure that inclusive leadership practices and accountability are embedded in our culture globally. In 2023, we augmented our  2020 milestone goal to  “Accelerate US representation of African American  employees at senior, director, and executive levels by  30% by the end of 2023“ By revising our objective to “Achieve 5% representation of Black/African American employees in senior, Director, and Executive roles within  the US by 2030,“ this goal language was changed from “Advance accessibility and underrepresented minorities  in senior leadership roles.“ Intel aims to increase the percentage of employees who self-identify as having a disability to 10% of our workforce. We believe that an inclusive culture that welcomes all perspectives is critical for attracting, retaining, and progressing top talent. We continue to work toward ensuring  employees have a voice and  creating a sense of belonging. Intel is committed to providing a work environment where employees from all backgrounds are valued,  respected, challenged, acknowledged, and rewarded. Through our RISE goals, we seek to drive further advancement in the representation of women in technical positions and women and  underrepresented minorities (URMs) in leadership positions. In 2023,  1,515 women and 466 URMs held senior leadership positions. We continued our focus on hiring, retention, career development, and  progression for all employees, including women and URMs. and embedding inclusive leadership practices in our culture. Intel US employees who identify as having one or more disabilities increased from just below  5% in 2022 to 5.3% in 2023. The percentage of employees  who identify  as veterans dropped slightly. Technical representation of URMs and women  increased slightly. Global representation of technical women increased from 24.7% in 2022 to 25.0% in 2023. We remain steadfast in our efforts to build a diverse  workforce that represents our world. We recognize that this will require  persistence and a long-term, sustainable strategy.

Intel’s ambitious goals are designed to continue to raise the bar  for ourselves and the industry to deliver greater value through  corporate responsibility excellence. We expect to achieve those goals by strengthening our systems, processes, and programs to drive diversity, equity, and inclusion. Achieve 25% representation of women in senior leadership roles and achieve 12% representation of URMs in US senior leadership roles. Read  about our other inclusion goals in “Accessibility and Disability  Inclusion” and “Supplier Diversity and Inclusion.” In 2023, we surpassed our annual milestone  goal of 18.9%, ending the year at 19.0%, or 1,515 women in senior  leadership roles across the globe. We took on and exceeded a flat  milestone goal and established plans in readiness for incremental  goals in the upcoming year. US URM senior leaders, which increased from 8.1% in 2022 to over 8.2% in 2023. In 2024, we aim to strengthen our current momentum, focus on  retention, and leverage hiring opportunities to attain our short-  and long-term goals. 24.9% of technical roles were held by women globally as of April 30, 2020. In 2024, we will continue to focus on increasing  representation through ongoing education and outreach programs, particularly at new manufacturing sites where women are needed. In 2024,  our corporate-level Annual Performance Bonus related goal is to maintain 18% global hiring rate of our non exempt women into our technical roles. Intel previously had  no presence. We are investing in local schools as we aim to connect  community members with work in technical roles at Intel. 1.4% of Intel’s global workforce and 2.9% of US employees self-identified as having a disability as of December 2020. At the end of 2023, 2.4%. Intel will expand the use of our disability self-identification tool in 2024. We will have 5.3% of. employees with a disability in our global workforce by 2030. Prior to a 2023 update, this goal language was “Double the number of women and  underrepresented minorities (URMs) in senior leadership goals.” With a focus on  percentages rather than absolute numbers, the updated goal language reflects our  commitment to industry best practices, market availability alignment and helps us  to continue to advance our mission. The April 30 baseline aligns with the completion of our annual  performance review process and promotion cycle. For transparency, we intend to  continue to report progress to goals using both percentages and absolute numbers. Prior to the 2023 update, this goal language was, “Advance accessibility and increase the  percentage of employees who self-identify as having a disability to 10% of our workforce  by 2030.” Since 2019, we have achieved gender pay equity globally and we continue to maintain  race/ethnicity pay equity in the US. We maintain pay equity by closing the gap in average pay between employees of different genders or race/ ethnicities. updated to clarify the global versus US baseline percentages. Intel’s legal and human resources teams work with third-party experts using established statistical modeling techniques to monitor and  advance global pay equity. Our comprehensive analysis includes  base pay, bonuses, and stock grants. Individual employees who are  identified as having a gap through this analysis are fired. Inclusion is one of Intel’s core values and it is at the heart of our culture. The Intel Code of Conduct and Intel Global Human Rights Principles and Approach set out our commitment to nondiscrimination and to provide a workplace free of harassment. We have taken actions to integrate our inclusion expectations into our  policies, performance management systems, leadership expectations,  annual bonus metrics, and employee surveys. Intel has launched Inclusion@Intel, an enterprise-wide portal. The company has also redesigned its employee performance management system and leadership promotions process to focus on results delivered, as well as how those results are achieved. Inclusion is a skill, and we continue to invest in tools and training to enable employees to practice it daily. Intel's Inclusive Leaders program is designed to equip managers and employees to play leadership roles in growing Intel’s inclusive culture. We have developed a set of best practices  and training to help mitigate the influence of unconscious bias in the  hiring process. In 2023,  we refreshed our required “Inclusive Hiring” training for our global hiring  managers. This training was created to help standardize our hiring  approach and to standardize the hiring process. These practices include posting of formal requisitions  for the majority of internal positions, using impartial descriptions of  qualifications for open jobs. The 2023  inclusion goals included women representing 30% of technical,  salaried early career hires. enable managers to role model inclusive hiring practices. increase by another 10% the  representation of Black/African American employees in senior,  director, and executive positions. We exceeded our 30% hiring  goal for women in technical global, salaried early career roles,  closing the year at an over 31% hiring rate. We fell short of our  goal to reach 3.69% representation of Black/African American  senior, director, and executive-level roles in our US workforce. We spent $1.6 billion with diverse suppliers. Intel received the following awards related to  our inclusion leadership in 2023. Intel has a record year in 2022, when we first exceeded our  2030 $2 billion ambition. We define early career employees as employees with salary grades 2-6. American Association of People with Disabilities and Disability:IN. Disability Equality Index – top score of 100.

Some 23% of our employees are members  of ERGs, and approximately 10% are members of  more than one ERG. More than 1,500 Intel leaders serve as role models of leadership and champions of the company’s ERG members and initiatives. Their mission is to promote the progression  and growth of diverse employees and foster an inclusive culture where  all employees can thrive professionally. Islander Leadership Council, Intel Network of Executive Women, Intel Veteran Leadership Council and Out and Ally Leadership Council host sponsorship programs. Council members are usually at the director or principal engineer level or  above. A sponsor at the executive or senior vice-president level supports each council. Intel’s ERGs and Affinity Groups are organized around race, national origin, gender identity, parenthood,  disability, education, faith and beliefs, and other common affinities. We  encourage employees to participate in ERGs  to build relationships with a wider community and exchange learnings. Getting involved with ERGs or Affinity Groups offers employees many benefits. These benefits include building networks, gaining leadership skills, learning about other business groups at Intel. These experiences help employees grow  their skills and build their careers in new ways. Employees who are members of at least one ERG, Affinity Group, or  Leadership Council see a progression rate of 1.3% higher than employees  who are not members. The 889  ERG events held in 2023 had an average satisfaction score of 96%. 62% reported that ERGs provide a sense of community or support that helps them stay at Intel. The groups help them develop at Intel through networking, career development, mentorship, or sponsorship. In 2022 we formalized our social crisis  response into a structured process. In 2023, Intel will combine its annual ERG conference with the Alliance for Global Inclusion’s Power of All conference. The conference will provide an opportunity for the 750,000 employees of the Alliance to better understand the positive impact diversity and inclusion have on business, retention, and engagement. Our ERGs are part of the engine that drives community and inclusion at Intel. The vast variety of these groups reflects how Intel tries to  include and empower every employee to embrace a sense of belonging.

Through our regular Employee Experience Survey, employees can voice their perceptions of the company and their work experience. Employees  from 52 countries were invited to participate. We shared results with  employees and enabled them to ask questions about actions. In our 2023 EES, our culture  scores held strong, reflecting our culture journey over the past several  years. Intel's overall favorability score was 81%, which is very high for employee surveys. 91% of responding  employees reported, “I am treated with dignity and respect at work” and 90% reported “Intel creates and environment where people of diverse  backgrounds can succeed” Intel's favorability score is down from 2022's highest recorded score of 85%. CEO: ""Results indicate that we need to do a better job building  belief in Intel’s future"" ""We still have  work to do to return to the historically high scores from 2022,"" he says. 89% of employees who participated  in our 2023 EIS reported, “Intel provides a safe and inclusive workplace for people like me.” A wide range of experiences reported by  different demographic groups indicates that we can continue to improve  the inclusivity of our culture. 77% of responding employees agreed with the statement, “The unwritten norms and workplace practices at Intel support  people like me.” The new data provides Intel with the opportunity to  address perceptions of workplace practices and seek to ensure our work culture supports all employees. 88% of responding  employees agreed with the statement, “My manager values diverse  talents, beliefs, backgrounds, and experiences.” We will continue to  provide education, inclusive leadership skills development, and  additional training to people managers. Intel has developed a set of programs and initiatives intended to support inclusive hiring, retention, and progression of all of our employees. Inclusive hiring practices include, in part, providing a  pool of diverse applicants. We seek to make Intel a place where employees can continually grow and  evolve their careers. In 2023, we launched Career Compass, a comprehensive portal that  helps all employees navigate their career. We have invested in programs that help us  to reach underrepresented candidates, give all candidates equal  opportunities to compete for jobs, and hire the best available talent. Along with our refreshed job titles and associated skills, Career  Compass makes it easier for employees to navigate their careers. Employees can chart their own career  pathways. The portal enables employees to: Explore career options and find their places in our world-changing work. Find open opportunities that match their skills and interests to advance their careers. Build skills by taking development into their own hands with learning resources, career courses, and training opportunities.  Career Compass also connects employees to Degreed, a “one-stop  shop’ for learning and career development resources in various fields. In 2023, popular Degreed courses included everything from coding in Python and using ChatGPT for business writing. A total of 436 employees and 263 managers have completed the program since launch. Employee participants showed better promotion and retention rates than their counterparts. Our confidential retention Warmline service provides employees with  guidance through challenges in areas such as promotion, retention and career development. Warmline provides a robust data set to help us identify  patterns, locate problem areas, and address issues proactively and  systemically. Some 88% of employees who used the Warmline service in 2023 have stayed at Intel and 99% would recommend the service  to others. Of the executives who used the Executive  Warmline since its launch in 2021, 91% have stayed at Intel. We also aim to support various  pathways to join Intel along a  career journey. For those  beginning their career, we engage with internal business  units, Intel leaders, and external organizations to support under­ represented. The Intel Scholars Program offers financial scholarships and exposure to Intel jobs. Since 2022, 62 program participants have become  permanent. For people who have taken a career break of more than one  year in the US, we expanded  Intel’s Relaunch Your Career pilot to an enterprise program. Of the  62 employees, 13% are URMs and 100% are in technical roles. In 2023, Intel employees promoted our LGBT+ inclusion across the industry in two sessions  at the 2023 Out & Equal Workplace Advocates Summit. Intel also launched an internal visible role models web site, giving  employees the opportunity to opt in, share their stories, and serve as  visible representatives of their community at Intel. In 2023, the Intel  Pride Leadership Council (IPLC) launched Safe Space, a quarterly  forum aimed at providing Intel Pride ERG members the  forum. Intel launched a pronoun badge sleeve program in 2023. The new sleeve is available with a standard and fab- approved pouch that can display a tag with pronouns or the Intel Values. Using correct pronouns helps create an inclusive environment, and the badge plays a crucial role in fostering that. In 2023, IPLC hosted eight IPLC Speakership Series sessions and continued its mentorship program. The  Intel Pride ERG commemorated Transgender Day of Visibility with a panel on safety and inclusivity of gender-neutral bathrooms. Local chapters also hosted in-person flag raising ceremonies at multiple sites and participated in Pride parades around the world. October’s National Coming Out Day featured a  talk on LGBT+ equality in Europe and a networking and social gathering at the Virtual Pride Month Sendoff. Intel’s Gender Transition Toolkit was updated in 2023, including guidance on how backend office system changes  may be made without requiring a change in name. Several members of the transgender community at Intel were consulted to help clarify how chosen names  could be entered in our people systems. The toolkit was also reorganized and formatted to make it  easier to use. Topics include steps to transition, resources, case studies, guidelines and expectations, definitions,  and FAQs. It also includes sample letters and transition plans, checklists, and announcement templates. Of those who responded to the survey as members of the LGBT+ community, about 53% indicated they have visible role models at Intel. 66% shared that being part of the Intel Pride ERG had a positive impact on their progression. LGBT+ employees who are engaged in the Intel pride ERG are more likely to be out at work. According to the World Health Organization, 1.3 billion people—16%  of the world’s population—experience a significant disability. Intel Corporate Accessibility Policy outlines our commitment to creating a culture of accessibility and broader impact through our technology. Intel works to advance accessibility through a three-pillar strategy centered on our workplace, products, and industry. Learn more about accessibility, innovation, and product  development at Intel in the “Accessiblity Innovation” section of the  report and on our Accessibility at Intel website. In 2023, the Intel Accessibility Office launched an Accessibility  Champions Network. The network enables Intel employees to commit to being  Accessibility Champion by pledging to make things accessible. “I commit to progress over perfection.  Through practice, I will get better at making  things accessible, noticing inaccessible  things and advocating for accessibility” —Intel Accessibility Champions Network Pledge. The Accessibility Champions Network also facilitates individual and  career development in accessibility through a digital badging program. With  the network, we aim to connect and activate champions to drive change within their teams and across Intel. The network is foundational in our  approach to building a culture of accessibility through awareness,  education, and enablement. Intel currently has over 200 Accessibility Champions who have  taken the pledge to develop their accessibility skills. The Intel Disability and Accessibility. recognize employees who develop their  accessibility and advocacy skills starting with being teammates who help  make Intel a great place to work for people with disabilities. IDAN has a presence  at 12 of our sites worldwide and is supported by the Intel Disability  Leadership Council. These groups advocate for and work to advance  and retain our disability community. In 2023, we expanded and formalized our IDAN peer-based group  offerings to include ADHD, auditory, cancer, caregivers, chronic  migraine, dementia, diabetes, neurodiversity, and vision. Intel received a top score of 100 on the Disability Equality Index. Intel was named one of the Best  Places to Work for People with Disabilities. In 2024, we are continuing to foster and add  peer groups. these peer groups had engaged 10%  of IDAN members. Intel has shared responsibility to address structural inequalities impacting employees and communities. Social equity is an extension of our  Global Human Rights Principles and Approach, and it means creating inclusion policies and practices. We further  believe that accelerating equity is critical to successfully strengthening  our culture of inclusion and belonging. The need for social equity at Intel continues. Globally, issues of social justice, human rights, and equity continue to arise and are critical for business. Our approach to social equity supports our business growth and talent goals and focuses on a world in which all people, regardless of their identity or background, have equal voice, representation, and access to opportunities. Intel's support for social equity starts inside the company. In 2020, we established milestone representation goals to help accelerate US  representation of African American employees at senior, director,  and executive levels by 30% by the end of 2023. Setting interim  milestones helped to create sustained focus as we focus on root causes. ""We made  notable progress in 2022, 2023 year-end progress fell just short of the  30% milestone goal,"" the company said. ""We have recalibrated  our efforts and established a new objective. Our revised goal is to achieve  5% US representation of African American"" ""We have added efforts to focus on development  and retention opportunities,"" the company says. ""Going forward, we seek to drive sustainable  change by improving equitable outcomes,"" it adds. ""We want employees in these leadership  positions by 2030, which reflects our dedication to sustaining meaningful progress"" Achieve 5% representation of Black/African American employees in senior, director, and executive roles in the US. training, development, and systems-  level change. We believe that mitigating bias in systems to foster an  inclusive culture is a business imperative and key to our long-term success. At the end of 2023, Black/African American representation in senior, director, and executive roles in the US was 3.22%. We acknowledge we have made some  progress, but even greater leadership and accountability are needed to create and sustain long-term change. Our revised goal of achieving 5% is to reflect our customers and communities. U.S. representation of Black/African American employees in senior, director, and executive roles in the  US by 2030 will require systems-level solutions. In 2024, as we focus on the implications for our  workforce and business, we must take deliberate and proven measures to enable the full participation of all. Intel aims to increase its. representation of African American employees at senior, director, and  executive levels by 30% by the end of 2023. We continue to support the development of a more diverse technology industry through investments, collaborative initiatives, and. Alliance for Global Inclusion is working to drive full inclusion and accessibility across the technology industry. We are also working to inspire more girls and women and  underrepresented minorities to pursue and succeed in technology careers through education initiatives, financial assistance, and internship opportunities. The Alliance for Global Inclusion is a coalition focused on creating a shared set of diversity and inclusion metrics. The vision of the Alliance is to create a transparent path to improve  diversity andclusion outcomes in industry for people, products,  and communities. The Alliance is a global network of executives and leaders that will amplify and accelerate  inclusion outcomes. Founding members of the Alliance included Dell, Intel, Nasdaq, NTT  DATA, and Snap Inc. Today the Alliance comprises 20 companies  working together, with a collective global reach of more than 755,000 employees. The Alliance recognizes that one size does not fit all. Fostering inclusive business practices requires a personal commitment from the first-line manager to the C-Suite. Intel Capital, our venture capital organization, has continued its  commitment to diversity across the globe. In 2022, approximately 20% of Intel Capital's venture stage dollars committed were in start-ups led by diverse leaders. In August  2020, Intel Capital announced a commitment to double its investments in Black founders over the next five years. At the end of 2022, approxi­ mately 6% of our venture. We invested over $5 million over the past five years in historically  Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to support student research  and retention programs in preparation for semiconductor careers. We have collaborated with top HBCU engineering and computer science programs at Florida A&M, North Carolina A&T, Morgan State, Tuskegee,  Prairie View A&m, and Howard to create advanced programs. Since 1981, Intel has collaborated with the National  GEM Consortium to advance the next generation of STEM professionals. Intel has given nearly $4 million to support the GEM Fellowship Program, which aims to increase participation of  underrepresented groups in graduate STEM degrees. Intel pledged to North Carolina  Central University (NCCU), a $5 million grant over five years to help  the school create a first-of-its-kind tech law and policy center. This  engagement makes NCCU the only HBCU and only law school in the  country with a Tech Law Center. NCCU is one of only six HBCUs with a school of law. Intel commemorated the inaugural NCCU School of Law  Tech Law and Policy certificate graduates. We hosted two students  for the summer associate program and participated in Law &  Technology Summit as keynote speaker. The program is designed to help grow the pipeline of Black attorneys in tech and corporate practices. Second- and third-year law students who have identified an interest in technology-related legal careers are matched with practicing Intel attorneys or policy professionals for an academic year-long mentoring engagement. Intel believes a diverse supply chain supports greater innovation and  value for our business. Our commitment to a more inclusive supply chain continues to differentiate Intel globally in the semiconductor and high-tech industries. Our supplier diversity and inclusion efforts are  considered one of the strongest global programs across all industries. Our supplier diversity and inclusion program contributes significant  value to our supply chain. Broadening the competitive landscape as we work with suppliers has enabled us to identify new suppliers that were not on our radar previously. Our diverse supply  base is known for being agile, collaborative, and innovative. Many of our key customers, representing over 50% of our revenue in 2023, require us to report spending with diverse suppliers1 on a quarterly basis. We are equally pleased with  how our efforts engage our customers, stockholders, and employees in  a collective commitment help support an inclusive supply chain. providing  noteworthy overall value. Our overall diverse spending declined in 2023  from $2.2 billion in 2022 due to several factors, including a decrease in  overall procurement spends. In addition, the acquisition of several of  our previous diverse-owned suppliers by non-diverse companies. ""We are working to stay  on track toward our longer-term goals with a constant focus on process,  collaboration, and outcomes,"" the company says. ""We have integrated requirements for including diverse suppliers into  our supplier policy,"" it adds. 2  Our non-diverse suppliers report their own spending with diverse- owned suppliers and subcontractors. With the growth of the program,  we are pleased that we have more than 180 suppliers reporting lower- tier/subcontractor diverse supplier spends. Our focus on extending  our efforts through our lower-tier program to achieve best-in-class performance exemplifies our focus. Intel is committed to growing its spending with US Black-owned and global minority-owned suppliers. Intel has set a goal  to spend $500 million with minority suppliers over the next five years. The company's EPIC and Supplier Diversity Distinction awards recognize suppliers that exemplify Intel’s  standard of excellence. Intel plans to spend $2 billion. annually with women-owned suppliers outside the US by the end of 2025. We continue to focus on maintaining our success and  collaborating with suppliers and industry organizations to improve awareness, training, and opportunities to compete for Intel contracts. In 2023, as in previous years, Intel was  recognized as a leader in supply chain diversity and inclusion by sev­ eral organizations. This work has included close collaboration with  NGOs and certifying bodies, such as WEConnect International. We continued to share with  companies across industry sectors best practices on how to set up or  expand supplier diversity programs. including WEConnect International, the Women’s  Business Enterprise National Council , the National Business Inclusion  Consortium, and MSD China. $1.6 billion in annual spending with diverse suppliers as of January 1, 2020. $2 billion. $400 million in diverse spending resulted in a reduction in overall procurement spends. $1.2 billion in 2023 from $2.2billion in 2022 due to several factors. In 2024, we intend to continue to focus on maintaining  our success and collaborating with suppliers and industry organizations to improve awareness, training, and opportunities for supplier diversity and inclusion. We recognize certified diverse suppliers as businesses that are at least 51% owned,  operated, and diverse. “First-tier”suppliers” are companies from which Intel makes direct purchases. Lower-tier  suppliers are Intel subcontractors. While Intel recognizes these categories, they may vary in  accordance with local law. “Women’s” and “minorities’’ categories include those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. Jack’s Mechanical Solutions is a woman/Hispanic/veteran- owned business started by Gabe and Liz Martinez in 2004 in Rio Rancho, New Mexico. Jack's installs leading-edge  semiconductor manufacturing equipment that helps enable  Intel’S IDM 2.0 strategy.

Intel’s Supplier Diversity and Inclusion program in 26 countries and regions works with NGOs to identify and certify potential suppliers. “Our supplier diversity and inclusion program  has expanded the breadth of our value chain,” says Intel. Achieving  $1.6 billion in spends with diverse-owned  businesses in 2023 highlights our continued  commitment to the communities in which  we operate.“   —Frank Sanders, Intel Corporate Vice President,  and General Manager of Global Supply Chain Operations Inclusive // 2023-24 Intel Corporate Responsibility Report. We are continuing our efforts to achieve our RISE global challenge to advance inclusion and accessibility for millions of people. In 2023, we scaled several programs and collaborations with customers, governments, and other stakeholders in the areas of accessibility innovation, product and inclusive design, online learning. Accessible technology can enable people to acquire an education, have  a career, use government services, make purchases, pursue hobbies, and  much more. Access to information and communications technologies is  defined as a basic human right in the United Nations Convention on the  Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Intel's 13th Gen Intel Core™ processor family includes new features that enhance PC-to-device connectivity for one-click device connectivity. In 2022, we launched the  13th Generation Intel processor family, which included new features  that enhanced PC- to- Device connectivity. improve accessibility  experiences each year. In 2023, we built upon this progress by launching the new Bluetooth® LE Audio standard with Microsoft  Windows. Intel also worked with GN ReSound, a leading manufacturer  of hearing aid solutions, to improve people’s experiences when con­ necting hearing aids to Intel® Evo™ laptops. New assistive technologies use indoor navigation, assistive speech, 3-D printing,  and AI-driven machine translation technology to enable face-to-face  conversations between people who communicate through American Sign Language and those who don't. Windows 11 Insider Preview Build is available now. Intel's goal is to have all Intel user experience teams practicing inclusive design and research by 2030. In 2023, our adoption score decreased to 16.8%, which is attributed to a decrease in headcount and budget. In support of  inclusive research, the Inclusive Design Operations Program continued  the program that makes it easier to recruit. Intel has established a new job profile for Accessible  User Experience Specialists. Intel recognizes the need to train and hire experts in accessibility to create inclusive experiences both internally for  employees and externally for our customers, developers, and end users. 92% of jobs analyzed  require digital skills. Report found strong demand for digital skills across every industry and in almost every occupation. But today’s workforce lacks the required skills to fill these jobs. Digital readiness focused on emerging technologies like AI is critical for countries. The concept of digital readiness encompasses digital skills,  trust, and responsible use of emerging technologies for broader socio-  economic benefits. To expand  digital readiness of all people, we have been scaling the Intel Digital  Readiness Programs globally, aiming to collaborate with 30 countries   and 30,000 institutions worldwide. At year-end 2023, Intel had collaborated  with 28 countries with more than 50 public-private collaborations, enabled 23,970 institutions, and trained 5.8 million people. We also expanded the Intel Digital Readiness initiative. empower more than 30 million  people with AI skills for current and future jobs by 2030. Intel has expanded its AI. portfolio with new  AI courses, including AI for Youth content for grades 3 and up. The company also expanded the portfolio beyond AI to new areas such as digital trust (cybersecurity and semiconductors) In 2023, the first cohort of students completed our AI for Future Workforce program. These graduates are now taking on leadership roles at  companies like Tesla, McKinsey, and SeedAI. The program content now totals more than 1,500 hours. In the fall of 2023, using courses developed by Intel and other  companies, HCC began a 4-year bachelor’s degree program in Applied  Technology in Artificial Intelligence & Robotics. Our program footprint grew to 89 colleges across 39 states in the US,  with more than 40% offering full 2- and 4- year degrees based on Intel content. In the US, we engaged with Jobs for the Future to release the AI Ready  Workforce report. The report proposes a robust workforce-centric narrative of how to reshape, not replace, jobs with AI. This analysis covers the top  10 jobs in each of the five critical industries for US. Intel’s focus on responsible AI highlights our commitment  to address the AI skills gap in the US and around the world. To advance  AI skills in new ways, Intel collaborated with the National Science  Foundation (NSF) to support two key National AI Centers of Excellence. Georgia Tech University and Intel worked with National University to introduce AI skills to multiple new disciplines in STEM as well as the arts and humanities. Intel was commissioned  by the European Parliament and EU Commission to scale AI for Youth in Spain. Expanding our footprint, we began engaging in new countries and regions, such as Mexico, Ghana, Bulgaria, Albania, and Saudi Arabia. Intel launched an engagement with the Commonwealth, inaugurating a digital learning platform to enable public  sector officials in all 56 Commonwealth nations to demystify AI. In 2023, we revamped the third edition of the Intel AI Impact Festival: celebrating Responsible AI Innovation by the Next Generation.  AI Global Impact Festival to emphasize responsibility and inclusion. The virtual event attracted nearly 500,000 visitors from 84 countries. We  expanded our global reach, garnering first-time participants and winners from both Latin America (Mexico, Brazil, and Costa Rica) and South  Africa. High school girls from Costa Rica developed an AI-powered repository that allows  conservationists to identify native bees in the local ecosystem. Another  high school student from Warsaw, Poland developed an “AI Posture  Assistant,’ which reminds laptop users to correct their head or back positioning. Intel SFI’s Implementation Framework includes seven essential mind­ sets and skill sets. It addresses workforce readiness by emphasizing analytical, social- emotional, and technical skills, adapting to evolving job requirements. Key aspects include design thinking, computational. methodologies, fostering innovation and actively engaging students. The Intel SFI initiative aligns with Intel’s RISE goals, preparing students for a rapidly evolving job market. In 2020, the Intel Foundation and other  companies and foundations launched the Million Girls Moonshot (MGM) aimed at engaging millions more girls, youth of color, and youth from low-income households in STEM/STEAM learning. The initiative connects local after-school and summer programs with the resources they need to increase access and quality of STEAM programming for youth. The initiative includes raising awareness for  STEAM learning and igniting champions for STEAM, building the  capacity of educators through training and professional development, and curating curriculum like Intel Future Skills. MGM resources, training, and curricula reached 45,000 after-school  and summer programs. 68% are low income, 58% identify as BIPOC, 20% live in rural areas;  and 18% are English language learners. The number of youth who were deeply engaged rose from  140,000 to 220,000—a 57% increase—in 2023. Deep engagement occurs through repeated experiential learning opportunities over  time, establishing the mindset to shift through consistency of practice. Intel introduced a new global award for students utilizing AI to  promote accessibility. Three groups of students from Thailand,  Brazil, and Singapore were chosen as winners. In Singapore, a student-built AI-powered program that allows users with dementia to navigate physical spaces more confidently. The Moonshot Ohio community collaboration strategy now engages 92 programs, universities, nonprofits,  museums, school districts, and businesses. Within the state, we reached 834  educators across 260 programs and 9,444 youth, nearly double our  goal of 5,000. Among Ohio youth reached, 40% are girls, 94% are low- income, and 95% are BIPOC. Moonshot Ohio brings together powerful collaborations across the  state to transform STEAM learning and complement existing public and private sector investments. In addition to creating economic opportunity for youth and strengthening the advanced manufacturing talent pool  in Ohio, Moonshot Ohio will expand community outreach, engaging 92 local organizations, and inspiring 886 students. The Intel Future Skills program aims to give students the framework needed for a lifetime of problem solving and  discovery through STEAM learning. The program's learning platform is  made up of more than 60 hours of learning experiences. this initiative will help galvanize the community behind a more  diverse, equitable future for all. The Intel Employee Service Corps combines technical learning with social emotional learning. The model enables students to recognize and understand the people they are creating for by building essential skills like empathy and creative problem solving. We provide this content online at no cost.  In addition, Intel employee service Corps skill-based volunteers dedicate their time and talent. In 2023, the Intel Foundation  collaborated with the STEM Next Opportunity Fund to facilitate three fully accessible Intel Future Skills summer STEAM camps for more than 430 Ohio students in grades pre-K through 8. They also activated 12 Intel  Future Skills pilots in 20 locations, reaching over 1,300 K-8 students in Columbus, Cincinnati, and Cleveland. The rapid growth of AI has opened up new possibilities for developers to innovate and create  experiences that help people worldwide. Open standards are essential  to advancing modern businesses and improving productivity. In 2023, Intel delivered a worldwide training series that helped developers learn new, impactful tools and techniques. 30 technical webinars for  17,000 participants and over 430 hands-on workshops providing training to over 42,000 developers. More than 400 technical training videos have  been viewed 36 million times by the worldwide community. In 2023, 15,000 students participated in Cal Hacks, the largest  collegiate program in the world. Intel delivered workshops, meetups,  and mentorship to the hackathon's enthusiastic crowd for three days. Three hackathon teams won Intel Developer Cloud credits, which  provide access to more hardware options that developers can use to  further their projects. “We look forward to more  engagement on AI by Intel. Asante sana [thank you very much.].” —Faith Njoki Karanja, Associate Professor  (Geoinformation – University of Nairobi)  and Science Consultant – STEM/ICT Lead Sustainable // 2023-24 Intel Corporate Responsibility Report. Intel has set company-wide environmental targets. In 2023, we achieved 100% renewable electricity for our US, Europe, Israel, Malaysia, Vietnam, and China locations. We are approaching 100% in Costa Rica—bringing the global total to 99%. In 2023, we conserved 43% of Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our 2019 baseline. We published  our Climate Transition Action Plan, outlining the steps we’ll take over the next three decades toward  more sustainable products and operations. We’re considering the risks and opportunities associated with climate change. In 2023, circular economy practices were applied to approximately 10.2 billion gallons of water. 63% manufacturing waste upcycled. We maintained net  positive water in the US and India. We reached net positive water  in two additional countries: Costa  Rica and Mexico. 63% of our manufacturing  waste streams via reuse, recovery, or recycling. We also collaborate with governments, other  companies, our suppliers, and nonprofits to help others reduce their own environmental impacts. We have long worked to reduce the environmental impact  of our operations. RISE is committed to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions by 2040 and net- zero upstream Scope 3 GHG emissions  by 2050. In addition to our sustainability goals, our strategy includes creating a  collective approach to reduce GHG  emissions across the semiconductor industry. ""We recognize that solving the world's environmental challenges requires broad, collective action—action that starts with individuals,"" Intel says. ""We have long encouraged our employees' passion for  the chemistry  technology industry initiative,"" Intel adds. ""Our unique methodology to calculate our manufacturing chemical footprint will be instrumental in helping us to identify projects to soften that footprint,"" the company says. Intel Oregon employee volunteers helped restore wetland habitats in 2023. In Malaysia, a team in Malaysia cleaned a local beach and sorted materials at a recycling center. We believe that Intel's position in the technology ecosystem, our  wide range of products and solutions, and our local communities will make a difference in the world.

We also work to identify ways that Intel technology can help others reduce their climate impacts. Our Climate Change Policy outlines our  formal position. We are committed to reducing our emissions streams in collaboration with our suppliers by 2030. Intel has set aggressive greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals. We invest in GHG reductions through  chemical substitution, GHG abatement, energy conservation, process  optimization, and renewable and alternative energy. Our Climate Transition Action Plan, published in November 2023, details our climate-related goals, risks, and opportunities. We have avoided nearly 82% of our cumulative Scope 1  and 2 GHG emissions over the last decade. We have reduced our  absolute emissions by 78% from our peak year of 2006. We collaborate  with others in the semiconductor and other manufacturing industries to identify new and innovative approaches to reduce emissions. Reducing energy use in our operations is core to Intel’s overall climate  strategy and our sustainability goals. Cumulatively we conserved  approximately 1.6 billion kWh of electricity from the 2020 baseline through the end of 2023. Since  2020, we have invested $96 million in energy conservation projects in our global operations. In 2023,  approximately 84% of our global energy use was electricity. The Dalian, China site was sold subsequent to year-end 2021 as part of the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND  Memory business. Dalian is not included in our sustainability goals and metrics beginning in 2022. Intel has identified strategic investment opportunities in a number of areas. To reduce energy usage in operations,  we are investing in HVAC upgrades and heat recovery projects. For new  factory construction projects, we are incorporating energy efficiency into design and equipment selections.  2030 Goal: Energy Conservation Description. Achieve cumulative electricity savings of 4 billion  kWh from 2020 to 2030. Baseline. Progress measured from baseline of January 1, 2020. Progress in 2023. In 2023, we invested in projects that enabled  us to conserve an additional 160 million kWh of electricity. Intel has conserved a cumulative total of 1.6 billion kWh of electricity since  the baseline date. In 2024, we continue to invest in new  and innovative projects aimed at conserving an additional 125 million kWh of Electricity. We value transparency around our carbon footprint and climate risk and use the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate- Related Financial Disclosures. We seek to follow an integrated approach  to addressing climate change, with multiple teams responsible for managing climate-related activities, initiatives, and policies. Senior executives and the Board’s Corporate  Governance and Nominating Committee review climate governance and strategy. We describe our climate-related risks and opportunities in this report; our Climate Change Policy; “Risk Factors” within our  2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K; and in our most recent CDP Climate  Change survey, which is available on our Report Builder website. In 2023, we  employ a variety of climate- related assessments and scenarios across  multiple aspects of our business. In November 2023, Intel published its Climate Transition Action. A current mapping of our climate disclosures aligned with the TCFD  and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) framework is  included in the Appendix. Our Roadmap for Climate Action Intel's Sustainable. Plan (CTAP), detailing the company's path to reach net-zero GHG emissions. The CTAP is aligned with TCFD guidance on  transition plans. This plan demonstrates our commitment to integrating sustainability into our core business, building resilience  into our operations and value chain, and fostering innovation. During 2023, our Scope 1. and 2 GHG emissions decreased 43% from the 2019 baseline. This decrease was due in part to completion of energy conservation and other GHG. We expect to reach net-zero Scope 1 and 2GHG emissions by 2040. In 2024, we will continue to implement a project roadmap to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions while we expand our manufacturing capacity around the world. We expect to reduce approximately 25,000 metric tons of CO2e during 2024 through targeted projects within our operations. Our combined Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) emissions decreased 43%  on an absolute basis in 2023. We recalculated our GHG  emissions for the 2019 baseline year and going forward to incorporate refinements in  emission factors. Total emissions for 2019 differ from other instances in this report due  to rounding. See details of  our “2023 Scope 1 and 2 Greenhouse Gas Inventory by Location and Category” in the Appendix. Intel has voluntarily reduced its GHG emissions through significant investments and actions. Despite our growth and increase in manufacturing output and  complexity of our manufacturing process technologies, we have reduced our absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHGs emissions by 78% from our peak year in 2006. We avoided 82% of our cumulative Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions over the last decade. We are working to drive further reductions to reach net-zero  GHGs. For more information, see “Sustainable Manufacturing” later in this section. 2023 Scope 1 and 2 Greenhouse Gas Inventory by  Location and Category is included in the Appendix. Additional GHG emissions reporting is publicly available in our CDP questionnaire response on our Report Builder website. Council for Sustainable Development’s The  Greenhouse gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard is defined by Intel management. Emissions from manufacturing process, on-site fuel combustion, refrigerants and air travel total 845,000. Leased Vehicles and Commuting total 363,000 employee leased vehicles and commuting. Indirect/value chain includes 158,000 upstream and downstream transport.

Includes consideration of cloud  service provider publicly reported use of renewable electricity in data centers. 2 emissions (does not account for any renewable  electricity attribute purchases) = 3,130,000 metric tons CO2e/year. 3 calculation methods have  been refined to account for cradle-to-gate emissions, to clarify boundaries between categories 1 and 2. Location-based method emissions (does not account for any renewable electricity attribute purchases) = 268,000 metric  tons  of CO2e/year. Market-basedmethod includes renewable purchases. to improve temporal alignment between procurement and  emissions-reporting timelines. The U.S. strives to contribute to the global effort toward science-based GHG emissions reductions. However, we face challenges in gaining formal approval for an emissions-reduction target under the methodology of the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) Intel’s absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions peaked  in 2006, and since then we have reduced our absolute emissions by  78%. By not accounting for these historical reductions in Scope1 and  2 emissions, companies that have demonstrated leadership in early,  voluntary emissions reductions are at a disadvantage compared to companies that are now beginning their GHG reduction efforts. “We are challenged  by the near-term reduction requirement without the ability to account  for significant historical reductions. Second, demand for semiconductors is increasing, due in part to the role that technology plays in driving climate change solutions.” “It is a  journey, but I am pleased with the progress  our teams have made so far.” —Keyvan Esfarjani, Intel Executive Vice President and Chief Global Operations Officer and General Manager,  Foundry Manufacturing and Supply Chain Sustainable. Over the last five years, Intel’s  renewable electricity supply and attribute purchases have totaled  more than 37.9 billion kWh, enough to power more than 3.5 million  US households for one year. Over the last decade, the number of Intel's on-site alternative and renewable electricity projects has doubled. Intel now has more than 110 alternative and renewable electricity installations with capacity of more than 50,000 kW across 22 campuses. These installations use 22 different technology applications, such as solar hot and cooling water systems, mini bio-energy, motion  power, geothermal energy. Intel has been one of the top corporate purchasers of renewable electricity in the US for more than a decade. When installed, our projects are often the largest corporate on-site  projects of their type in a country or region. include pilots of innovative technology  applications. In 2023, we expanded our renewable electricity purchases for our  Vietnam and Chengdu, China sites. We purchase green attributes from  multiple sources of generation. These include wind, solar, hydroelectric,  and geothermal, many of which are certified and verified by nonprofit accreditors. Intel has contracted a new 30 MW  offsite solar Power Purchase Agreement. Once operational and  registered with the relevant authorities, will serve Intel's locations in Malaysia. ""Our approach to renewable and alternative electricity investments has  been to reduce our own carbon footprint while inspiring others to take  similar actions"" The Dalian, China site was sold subsequent to year-end 2021 as part of the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND Memory business. Dalian is not included in our  sustainability goals and metrics beginning in 2022. We achieved 99% renewable electricity across our global operations in 2023. In 2020, we had reached 100% renewable electricity in our US and European operations, 50% in our Israel operations, and 71% globally. We are also approaching 100% in Costa Rica—bringing  the global total to 99% as of the end of 2023. We will continue developing renewable electricity. Intel is well on track to achieve our goal of 100% by 2030. Compute demand continues to drive increases in global energy consumption. This makes sustainable computing not only a corporate imperative, but also a global imperative.

Intel continues to work with China  National Institute of Standardization (CNIS) to help enable China’s  server energy-efficiency standard and Bench SEE (benchmark) tool improvements. Intel also worked  with industry peers and the Chinese Institute of Electronics to make progress toward development of multiple sustainability standards for PCs. Intel has estimated the GHG emissions due to energy consumption by Intel processors sold in 2023. The annual and lifetime emissions of  Intel processors when used in customers’ compute applications equate to approximately  3,253,000 and 14,040,000 metric tons of energy. Intel Core Ultra mobile processor-based notebooks total energy consumption can be as much as 64% lower than ENERGY STAR 8.0. In 2023, we introduced Intel Core™ Ultra mobile processors that  deliver reimagined power efficiency, world-class compute and  graphics performance. Intel has taken a proactive approach to minimize  energy use in these scenarios. Users can consume up to 25% less power  while streaming Netflix entertainment with an Intel Core Ultra 7 165H processor, compared to a 13th Gen Intel Core™ i7 1370P processor. Streaming an Intel Core Ultra processor-based laptop instead of the previous-generation system could save enough electricity to power 1,600 US homes for a year. Increase product energy efficiency 10X for Intel client and server microprocessors to reduce our Scope 3 GHG emissions. The data center component of our product energy efficiency goal is measured using SPEC® Server Efficiency Rating Tool (SERT®) suite5 on Intel and/or OEM commercial systems. Progress in 2023 will be measured using an end-of-2019 baseline. Intel 13th generation Intel Core™ mobile processors as well as Intel 14th generation desktop processors include more efficient cores. As a result, we are on track to achieve our aggressive interim goal of  3.46X compared to the 2019 baseline. In 2023, we released our 5th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors, which achieved approximately 2.1X improvement in energy efficiency vs. the 2019 baseline. This is within 10% of the  planned trajectory of 2.3X toward 10X improvement by 2030. We plan to report on server progress toward the 10X goal. We continue to monitor user needs and have observed that demand for AI in PCs has grown, resulting in a new focus on active workloads. 2030 goals based on planned release of next-generation Intel Xeon Scalable  processors in 2024.

Sustainability, Intel Performance Index 23 Mobile Data Traffic: Global Strategic Business Report. 2023-24 Intel Corporate Responsibility Report 81. In 2023, we returned and restored 110%1 (by volume) of our fresh water  withdrawals to our communities through efficient water management,  water reuse, and project funding that enabled water restoration in local watersheds. Our water strategy has three focus areas: reduce the water used in our operations through innovative water. As a part of our 2030 RISE goals, we aim to  achieve net positive water by conserving 60 billion gallons of water (cumulative from 2020) and funding water projects that will restore  more fresh water than we consume to our local watersheds. Our water conservation efforts saved approximately approximately. Since 2020, our water conservation efforts have saved  more than 36 billion gallons of water, enough to sustain about 330,000  US homes for one year. During 2023, we continued to fund water restoration projects benefiting  the watersheds that we impact and the communities where we operate. In July 2023, we achieved Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Platinum certification for our Ocotillo, Arizona site. See details in our “2023 Water Inventory by  Location and Source” in the Appendix. Additional information is also available in our most recent CDP Water Security report. Net positive water is achieved when each country reaches its specific target. Some locations have returned and restored significantly more than their targets, resulting in  a global total greater than 100%. Refer to “2023 Water Inventory by Location” for more information. 2023 absolute fresh water use decreased 4% from 2022 and 24% from the 2020  baseline. We increased our water conservation by 6%  from 2022 to 2023, and by 44%  since the baseline year of 2020. We define water withdrawals, or water usage, as total water usage. “Operations” includes all manufacturing and non-manufacturing sites with  2,000 or more employees where Intel has operational control. “Net  positive water’ is defined as water returned through water manage­ ment practices, plus water used. During 2023 we conserved approximately 10.2  billion gallons and 36 billion gallons cumulatively from the 2020  baseline. In addition, Intel-enabled projects restored about 3.1 billion gallons of water to our watersheds in 2023. As a result, we  maintained net positive water in the US and India and reached net positive water in two. In 2024, we expect to conserve and restore a  total of 13.5 billion gallons of water in our operations, community  collaborations, and watershed restoration projects. We expect to  maintain net  positive water in 2024 and 60 billion gallons by 2030. additional countries: Costa Rica and Mexico. Intel is committed to achieving net positive water in the US, India, Mexico, and Costa  Rica. We are well on track to achieve our water conservation goal  by 2030. Our Penang site in Malaysia reclaims wastewater from our assembly  test manufacturing (ATM) operations. The reclaimed water is then recirculated in cooling towers, reducing overall fresh water withdrawals. The project was expanded in 2023 to achieve double  the water savings, or an additional 7 million gallons of water conserved  per year. We continue identifying opportunities to segregate and recover rinse water and bypass flows from our process manufacturing equipment. The first system was installed  in 2023 in our new F34 factory in Ireland, and is expected to conserve  approximately 200 million gallons of water per year when fully imple­ mented. Further retrofits to implement this project are planned in our  other factory sites in 2024. Agua Tica was established as the first public-private  water fund in Costa Rica. One of its objectives is to promote water  restoration through forest protection agreements. This project, which  follows the successful implementation of Phase I funded by Intel in 2020, is protecting almost 540 acres of mature and/or secondary forest. The Agua Tica water project is expected to enable the restoration of 71.3 million gallons of water per year near San Jose, Costa Rica. CLEAN International is implementing rainwater harvesting systems to provide a more resilient and sustainable water supply for students and staff in Vietnam. The Saigon River basin has experienced declining groundwater due to population  growth, seasonal flooding, water pollution, and saltwater intrusion. Rainwater harvesting can help mitigate these risks by capturing excess runoff and using it to decrease groundwater extraction. This project will  implement rainwater harvesting systems at 86 local schools. The majority of Intel’s waste originates from construction and manufacturing activities. Our focus on improved management of  waste results in materials being kept in use longer. As part of our RISE goals, we remain committed to identifying innovative ways to achieve resilient and sustainable water supply. From 2022 to 2023, manufacturing waste decreased by 28% and construction waste increased as a result of our global expansion. Across  our global operations, we have implemented waste prevention projects ranging from the removal of single-use cups at hot drink dispensing machines to applying waste materials from one construction project to another. Our 2030 waste-to-landfill definition includes hazardous waste and non-hazardous solid  waste. In line with common  waste reporting practices, we do not include salts and biosolids from our on-site water  reclaim. Achieve zero waste to landfill and implement circular  economy strategies for at least 60% of our manufacturing waste streams in collaboration with our suppliers. Wastes for which local legislation prevents  landfill diversion are not included. facilities in Israel, Oregon, and Arizona. In 2023, we sent 6% of our waste to landfill and implemented circular strategies for 63% of manufacturing waste. Management of construction waste will remain a key focus area during our global expansion and across our existing  sites around the world. Intel defines zero waste to landfill as less than 1%. In 2023, we upcycled 76,000 tons, or approximately 63%, of our manufacturing waste. In 2024, we will continue to focus on the  identification of markets for spent chemicals, landfill diversion,   and upcycling of waste streams. Upcycling is defined as keeping  products and materials in use via reuse, resale, repurposing, and recycling. It includes recovering and restoring products, components, and materials through strategies like reuse, repair, remanufacturing, use as feedstock, and’recycling. It does not include fuel waste associated with wafer manufacturing. Major semiconductor manufacturing-related waste streams include lithography-related solvents, metal plating waste, specialty base  cleaners, spent sulfuric acid, ammonium sulfate, and calcium fluoride. Intel operations also generate plastic, metal, kitchen, and general  office waste. In 2023, we upcycled (reused, recovered, or recycled) 63% of our manufacturing waste, or approximately 76,000 tons. We have put significant effort into finding alternate strategies for managing our spent solvent wastes, resulting in additional environmental  benefits. For example, two years of work spent redesigning process tools  and recipes enabled the on-site recovery of materials. Intel has invested in robust. segregation of cyclohexanone and its  recovery for resale in 2023. These activities supported our goal of  circular economy management of our manufacturing waste. In addition,  they reduce GHG emissions at the supplier’s processing site. By con­ tinuing to identify opportunities to recover, recycle, and fuel blend spent  solvents, we were able to  avoid over 88,000 metric tons of CO2e in our value chain. Sulfuric acid waste from our manufacturing operations is sent to an off-site facility, where it is processed to technical grade sulfuric acid. It is then  directed back to  manufacturing operations, where we use it in on- site wastewater treatment systems. In Ireland, a treatment process to  generate a new pellet form of fertilizer using the factory's ammonium  sulfate waste was developed. Waste will be processed offsite with our waste vendors in 2023. This eliminates the need to export the waste for treatment and provides the raw ingredient needed to produce fertilizer in Ireland. Intel Corporate Responsibility Report  85 Supply Chain Sustainability Through engagement with our supply chain on environmental  sustainability, we aim to reduce environmental impact. We work with our suppliers to  decrease GHG emissions, water usage, and waste generated. Our procurement teams also work with  packaging suppliers to help drive changes in the materials we use to ship products. In addition, we work with first-tier chemical and gas suppliers on green chemistry initiatives. In 2023, we announced a new goal to achieve net-zero upstream Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2050. We also have an interim 2030 goal to reduce  supply chain GHg emissions by 30% from what they would be. to help identify areas of improvement. In 2023, we  continued leadership roles in the Governing Council and Working Groups  of the Semiconductor Climate Consortium. We also become a founding co-sponsor of Catalyze,  a a semiconductor emissions reduction initiative. in the absence of investment and action. CDP is a semiconductor industry collaboration that focuses on accelerating the transition to renewable electricity in the semiconductor supply chain. In 2023, we asked approximately 130 first-tier suppliers that have higher  environmental impacts to submit data on their own carbon footprints through the CDP Climate Change Questionnaire. About 99% of Intel's suppliers submitted a climate change questionnaire. 97% of those suppliers made their responses public. The information gives Intel and other stakeholders information about the environmental performance of Intel’s supply chain. We also sent the CDP Water Security Questionnaire to nearly 60 suppliers  located in water-stressed regions. In 2023, we  drove further reductions by converting 53% (up from 15% in 2022) of  all capital freight shipments from air freight to ocean freight. We will  continue developing domestic truck and international projects. achieved a 98% response rate, with  96% of those suppliers publicly sharing their responses. Intel has achieved 99% renewable electricity in its global operations. The company is working with its suppliers to ensure they have robust internal processes in place to provide emissions reporting data. Intel is a founding member of the Global Logistics  Emissions Council. Catalyze aims to reduce Scope 3 supply chain GHG emissions by 30% from what they would be in the past. Catalyze: We are proud to help  remove barriers to choosing greener energy. Intel: Ultimately, we want our entire value chain to achieve net-zero GHGs. Each year, we request that a subset of suppliers with  higher environmental impacts submit data through the CDP Climate  Change Questionnaire. Our requirements also include setting at least one GHG  reduction goal or target. Progress toward our 2030 goal is measured as the impact of emissions avoided through first-tier supplier actions. Supplier GHG emissions reduction actions and  initiatives since 2021 have resulted in an estimated 9% of emissions  avoidance in our supply chain. Our 2050 goal includes all upstream Scope 3 GHG categories. To drive further action on supply chain  GHG,  Intel is using similar approaches as the allocation of supply chain emissions, relative to Intel’s total supply chain Scope 3GHG emissions. In 2024, we will continue to focus on advancing collective action on industry-wide emissions reductions through  active engagement in SCC. We will support supplier action toward  use of 100% renewable electricity as founding co-sponsors of Catalyze. Intel will engage with suppliers on calls to action to set  100% renewable electricity and net-zero targets. The application of circular economy principles across the supply and  value chain is a cornerstone of our drive to sustainability leadership. Intel’s supply chain plays a pivotal role through the implementation of circular  economy solutions for manufacturing. The consolidated efforts across the supply chain in 2023 resulted in: 3,500 tons of manufacturing equipment averted  from landfill through resale. 61 tons of IT computing assets averted from landfill though resale, and 2,000 tons of waste upcycling. 70% recovery rate on products returned to Intel. material containing precious metals reclaimed. 75,800 tons of manufacturing waste upcycled. 30 countries supported by global e-waste program. Intel introduced a prototype that dynamically manages the disposition of returned products from customers. Intel has a history of practicing sustainable packaging methods. We focus on reducing unfavorable material, increasing material efficiency, designing for recovery and recycling, prioritizing recycled content, and  sourcing responsibly managed materials. Working with suppliers, we developed a reusable packaging system. The thermoform tray is made out of a more recyclable material, polyethylene  terephthalate (PET), and weighs 50% less than a standard industry  injection molded tray. We worked to include post-consumer recycled  material into the thermoforming trays so that nearly half of the tray is  non-virgin material. ""We have eliminated over 23,800 metric tons of plastic material through  these initiatives,"" the company says. ""To drive further progress, we are working to achieve three additional  sustainable packaging targets,"" it adds. The company's goal is to ensure that 95% of the materials used in new product packaging designs will be recyclable or reusable by 2025. Intel is focused on  minimizing the use of virgin plastic in our packaging designs by 2030. our corrugated fiberboard packaging will be  from a certified, responsibly managed source by 2025. We are well on  track to reaching this target ahead of schedule. We. improve the efficiency with which natural resources are used to meet human needs for chemical products and  services. It encompasses the design, manufacture, and use of efficient,  effective, safe, and more environmentally benign chemical products  and processes. We stimulate the design and discovery of more benign chemicals, production processes, and product stewardship practices. Intel. established the Chemical Footprint Methodology as a key component of Intel’s RISE Sustainable Chemistry program to make our operations more sustainable. We will  continue to improve and update our methodology through our work with  suppliers, customers, and our industry collaborators. Intel performs a detailed risk assessment of our high-volume manufacturing chemicals. To ensure these risk  assessments are robust, we require full material disclosures from our chemical suppliers. Our chemical supplier EHS specification requires suppliers to assess the hazards of their formulations. In 2021, we released a policy regarding no new process applications utilizing n-methyl pyrrolidone. In 2022, we established a PFAS  policy for restricted fab material use for certain PFAS materials. We will continue to review and establish chemical policies as needed. PFAS are used in small  quantities in certain process chemicals. They can also be found in many  components within the electronics industry. In many of the process  chemical applications, there are no readily available substitutes. We are working with industry associations and our supply chain to assess the feasibility of their uses in high-volume manufacturing. Semiconductor Industry Association's Semiconductor PFAS Consortium. Group of more than 40 semiconductor manufacturers and suppliers focuses on gathering technical information about PFAS uses. In 2023, the consortium published 10 controls to be eliminated or reduced. Intel worked with SEMI, the trade association focused on supply chain, to drive supplier commitments to address PFAS. Intel and SEMI hosted workshops in 2023 where we encouraged suppliers to work toward substitution  plans for all PFAS and to identify pathways to overcome technical hurdles. The SEMI  PFAS Initiative focuses on work related to resiliency and  transparency. Intel continues its sponsorship and helps lead Semiconductor  Research Corporation research projects aimed at identifying,  developing, and implementing non-PFAS alternatives. Continued  support of academic research, consortia, and supply chain initiatives is  needed to further support  challenges. In 2023, as part of our Supplier Program  to Accelerate Responsibility and Commitment (SPARC), we asked our  chemical suppliers to begin screening all development materials. We continue to set expectations for our suppliers on our supplier portal. Intel screens high-volume materials,  against several health and environmental points. We also assessed our suppliers’ chemical policies to provide greater insight into how they could further support  Intel’s green chemistry and alternative assessment process. In 2023, we implemented the Supplier Sustainability Scorecard as a  holistic program. In 2024 we will continue the process and will  collaborate with suppliers on sustainability improvements. Intel is an active participant in the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)  Chemical Management and Environmental Work Groups, which work  to improve the electronics industry chemical management practices. The RBA helped to establish and scale the Clean Electronics Product Network’s (CEPN) Towards Zero Exposure Program, of which Intel is an active participant. The mission is to understand, address, and eliminate  workers’ exposure to chemicals in the electronics supply chain. Other electronics  trade associations such as Chemical Users Coalition, Sustainable PFAS Action Network, DIGITALEUROPE, American Chamber of Commerce  to the European Union, Information Technology Industry Council, and IPC International. These organizations regularly work with regulatory  agencies to provide technical information to show the industry’s safe use of chemical substances. Intel is working with the technology industry and other stakeholders to advance carbon- neutral computing. Conceptually, carbon-neutral computing is achieved when the positive  benefits of the ICT sector “handprint” are applied to reduce climate impact across the economy. Intel's global challenge framework includes collaborating with others to accelerate the sustainability of PCs, improve the energy efficiency of data centers, and accelerate handprint solutions to reduce  emissions across high-impact industries. Intel has taken a holistic approach to reducing carbon in technology systems. Intel has a carbon footprint approach across the entire PC life cycle.

The primary source of ICT emissions in the use phase is electricity used to power data centers and networks. One of the ways Intel processors enable a reduction in electricity usage is through AI-based telemetry. Intel processors incorporate telemetry capabilities to enable significant energy savings at scale. Intel’s Global Extensible Open Power Manager enables power and  energy optimizations on heterogeneous platforms. Power Manager reference software delivers power  savings while maintaining key telecommunications performance metrics. In near  commercial performance tests on a model network, several key 5G core software solution providers achieved a reduction of CPU power consumption by over 30% with no packet loss. 6 Data Center Measurement Best Practices. demonstrated power savings of up to 20% in a supercomputing cluster. Measurements and  standardized metrics are foundational to driving harmonized efficiency and carbon-neutral computing methodologies. Intel is collaborating with TGG and the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact in pursuit of top-down metrics. We are also leveraging our leadership role in the Open  Compute Project (OCP) Sustainability Initiative to pursue PUE reporting standards, and bottoms-up IT compute energy-efficiency metrics. This  includes incorporating liquid cooling technologies and infrastructure design standards to enable future software to self-monitor. Intel initiated a cross-Industry initiative and brought together major industry and academic players. Microsoft, Google, Alibaba, IBM, Dell, AMD, Ampere, ARM, Tenstorrent,  and MIT were involved. Intel is actively driving the definition and development of the benchmark. Up to 30% of the energy consumed by the data center can be attributed to running inefficient code. Intel provides code optimizations for developers that provide performance  and energy efficiency. These optimizations are available in Intel®  oneAPI, OpenVINO™ toolkit, and Kubernetes. Intel’s optimizations for TensorFlow, as part of  the Intel oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library, provide over 2X better  throughput for AI inference workloads. Intel created the  Kubernetes Power Manager to expose and use Intel specific power  management technologies such as Intel Speed Select Technology. Intel’s Granulate software-as-a-service offering enables companies to optimize cloud workloads. A recent addition to Granulate is an energy and emissions  counter, which enables results to be tracked across those vectors. With this software tool, Intel is enabling a reduction of cloud resources required to run. Mobileye has reported using 45% less time to run the same workload, saving an annual carbon equivalent of 30,000 kg. applications. Intel is a member of  the Green Software Foundation and has contributed to the Impact Engine Framework to model, measure, simulate and monitor the  impacts of software. The OCP working group has released specifications for  modular server components. Intel was an instrumental leader in the development and  official release of the server. Modularity calls for a  common building block design with verifiable interfaces to allow  for replacement of only those pieces in need. In 2023, a new specification was released for shared power,  cooling, and connectivity for 19"" and 21"" server racks. Intel modeled a  27% embodied carbon footprint reduction from implementing DC-MHS on upcoming Intel data center platforms. Intel announced a collaboration with Foxconn Industrial  Internet to create an optimized modular 5G vRAN DU (distributed unit) server. In 2023, Intel continued to evolve its  servicing program, which delivers security and functional updates.

Intel’s solution development is enabling the decarbonization of industries worldwide. One major focus area for Intel is enabling renewable energy through the implementation and deployment of a modern, smart grid. According to the International Energy Agency, according to the IEA, the world needs to reduce its carbon emissions by 20% by 2025. Investment in smart  grids needs to more than double through to 2030 to track with the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. To address  this, industries such as grid operators, utilities, and IT are rapidly deploying renewables and electrification globally. Intel’s Center of Excellence for Energy Sector is actively involved in  the creation, implementation, and expansion of the modern, smart grid. Intel-based software-defined substations help utilities integrate  renewable energy and enable operators to manage an increasingly  bi-partisan energy system. Intel has created coalitions and collaborations with leading utilities  and the broader ecosystem in the US, Europe, and Asia. Intel technology,  including edge analytics and processors, is foundational to energy services delivery platforms, including distributed energy resource management systems (renewables) Intel is a founding member and technical advisor of the Edge for Smart  Secondary Substations Alliance. The alliance is dedicated to developing an open and interoperable platform for next-generation smart grid  secondary substations.

Unlike many companies in the electronics industry, we manufacture the majority of our products in our own wafer fabrication facilities. As a result, Intel’s direct environmental footprint is more significant than those of our “fab-less” competitors. This business model also gives us a unique advantage when it comes to environmental issues. The Intel Code of Conduct, Climate Change Policy, Global Water Policy,  Energy Policy, and Environmental, Health, and Safety Policy guide our  sustainability strategy and help us set goals. Under these policies, we  strive to consider environmental impact when we select sites, design  buildings, set performance levels for manufacturing tools. Intel has maintained multi-site,  third-party-verified International Organization for Standardization  ( ISO) 14001 for all manufacturing locations since 2001 and ISO 45001  since 2020. Our Corporate Energy Management System is designed  to follow the ISO 50001 Energy Management Standard. We use abatement equipment such as rotary concentrator  thermal oxidizers, wet electrostatic precipitators, wet scrubbers, and  ultra-low NOx burners. We also conduct regular EHS program self-assessments to validate  EHS compliance at sites. Intel conducts internal audits related to compliance, management systems, and business risk at various Intel sites. The audits include in-depth documentation and records reviews,  interviews with site leadership, and physical inspections related to EHS compliance. Key to our chemical management strategy is a comprehensive review  of materials. The search includes Intel- specific restrictions (which often go beyond regulatory requirements), as well as local and global regulations. We then identify the environmental  and safety controls needed to protect personnel and the environment. In 2021, we launched new chemical  management software systems aimed at improving employee access  to hazard information. Intel reports emissions, waste transfers off-site, and treatment of reportable chemicals. We seek to do so in accordance with local and national regulations, such as those set by the US EPA. To better understand how Intel compares to others in our industry,  we regularly benchmark our environmental performance with semiconductor companies. Intel participates in organizations such as the Center for Climate and  Energy Solutions. We also engage our main  suppliers on sustainability issues to help them reduce their climate  and water impacts, reduce waste and identify circular solutions,  advance green chemistry and footprinting. In 2023, government officials made more than 220 visits to Intel facilities. The company is working with the government to improve compliance practices, and identify  collaboration opportunities. To learn more, see “Public Policy and Political Accountability” and  “Supply Chain Responsibility” in the Our Business section of this report.

Senior management is responsible for reviewing our NOVs to confirm that root cause corrective actions for   identified. 2023 bonus incorporated environmental-related metrics aligned to our 2030 and 2040 goals. Applicable historical data  were restated to correct minor discrepancies. Concerns are put in place and tracked to completion. We aim to achieve at least 95% of our goals by 2040. We achieved each of the targets, reaching 99% of renewable  electricity globally, reducing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 424,000  metric tons of CO2e, conserving and restoring 13 billion gallons of water, and sending 4% of waste to landfill by the end of 2023. In 2024, we will achieve 95% renewable electricity globally. We will also reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 25,000 metric tons of carbon  dioxide equivalent (CO2e) In 2023, for the fourth consecutive year, we achieved our green revolving credit facility. The green bond, which was announced in 2022, was part of a $6 billion overall debt public offering. In 2023, we published our first green bond impact report, summarizing  the allocation of $425 million of the $1.25 billion green bond proceeds. Projects that meet the eligibility criteria were  estimated to reduce Intel's GHG emissions by 5.3 million metric tons of  CO2e, save 4.5 billion gallons of water, and divert 56,000 tons of waste from landfills in 2021 and 2022. Intel has incorporated green design into the  new construction and renovation of our facilities. This helps us achieve efficiencies in energy consumption, water use, and recycling. We also collaborate with companies and nonprofits to expand the use of green technology.

Intel leads several global environmental  regulations influencing and harmonization efforts within multiple  industry. We strive to meet the requirements  of the European Union’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and  Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation. We also comply with applicable  product ecology regulations. Managing electronic waste (e-waste) such as computers, monitors,  and phones is a challenge. Most of our products fall within the scope of e-waste laws when they are incorporated into a final product,  generally by an OEM. We endeavor to work with OEMs, retailers,  customers, and others to identify shared solutions for used electronics. We also take steps to integrate environmental considerations into the  design of ourProducts. Intel supports the development of green procurement standards and tools. EPEAT and other eco-design directives are designed to help purchasers in the  public and private sectors evaluate, compare, and select electronic products based on environmental leadership and corporate social  responsibility attributes. PCF carbon footprints vary considerably by  company and geographical location. We believe consistency is needed, and we are accelerating the industry harmonization of PCF methods that relate to Intel products. We are  through leadership in the Scope 3 and the Emissions Reporting Protocol Working Groups in the Semiconductor  Climate Consortium. Our approach to modeling the embodied PCF1 of Intel processors is designed to follow the guidelines of the ISO 14067 standard and recommendations from the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Technical Report TR 62921.

Armstrong-Friberg, Lead Verifier  John Rohde, Technical Reviewer ESG Program Manager ESG Principal Consultant. In May 2020, we laid out our 2030 RISE strategy and goals. Since then, we have made progress on those goals and adopted both a new 2040 net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions goal and a goal to achieve net- zero  upstream Scope 3 emissions by 2050. This table contains progress updates from 2023. 90% of our employees believe that Intel has a strong safety culture. 50% participate in  our global wellness program. 87%  of employees from organizations that that Intel works with are responsible for employee health, safety, and wellness. The Intel Vitality Program continued to reach 90% of Intel’s  employee population in 2023. Supply Chain Human Rights. Scale our supplier responsibility programs to ensure respect for human rights across 100% of our contracted suppliers and all high risk-identified high-tech companies. In 2023, we reached 25%, through audits, validated third-party assessments, and attestation for lower risk contracted suppliers. We adjusted our progress on our path to  reach 100% of our verified contracted suppliers in 2030. Inclusive Workforce Inclusion. Achieved 25% representation of women in senior leadership roles (globally) Exceeded 40% representation of women in technical positions. 10%  representation of employees with a disability in our global workforce by 2030. In 2023, we surpassed our goal of 5% Black/African American employees in senior, director, and executive roles. At the end of 2023, Black/African American employees in senior, director, and executive roles in the US was 3.2%. We made progress in our representation of US URM senior leaders, which increased from 8.1% in 2022 to over 8.3%  in 2023. 2.4% of Intel’s global workforce and 5.3% of US employees self-identified as having a disability. 25.0% of technical roles were held by women, an increase from 24.7% at the end of 2022. Increase global annual spending with diverse suppliers by 100% to reach $2 billion in annual spending by 2030. We are on track to spend $500 million annually with women-owned suppliers outside the US by the end of 2025. In 2022, we exceeded our annual goal and achieved our 2030 ambition of $2 billion annual spending with diverse  suppliers for the first time. In 2023, this goal language was updated to reflect Intel’s  continued commitment to human rights for all high-risk identified suppliers. Prior to the 2023 update, these goals were “Double the number of women and underrepresented minorities in senior leadership roles” The goal language was “Advance accessibility and increase the percentage of employees who self-identify as having a disability to 10% of our workforce.” We recognize diverse suppliers as businesses that are 51% owned and operated by at least one of the companies listed. Women, minorities as defined by the country or region where the business was established; veterans/service-disabled  veterans; persons who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. While Intel recognizes these categories, they may vary by country in accordance with local law. Achieve a 10% reduction in our absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. Increase product energy efficiency 10X for Intel client and server microprocessors. Achieve 100% renewable electricity. Conserve 4 billion kWh of electricity.

This represented an important step in our RISE strategy, as we begin  mapping our supply chain for our highest priority minerals. In 2023, Intel advanced responsible mobility by continuing to contribute  to standards that improve road safety for automated vehicles (AVs) and re-architecting the automotive industry by creating a new generation of suppliers. We will continue to identify the highest priority minerals in pursuit of our RISE goals. Intel and SAE International announced a  committee to deliver an automotive standard for Vehicle Platform Power  Management (J3311) Intel will chair the committee. “Conflict minerals,” as defined by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is  a broad term that means tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold. Inclusive Inclusion Index. Drive full inclusion and accessibility across the  technology industry by creating and implementing an inclusive leader  certification program. As part of the Alliance for Global Inclusion, we helped create a global  inclusion index survey, which enables companies to track diversity and  inclusion improvements. The results of the third survey were published in 2023. Based on the  maturity of respondents’ best practices, the survey results transitioned  to an index. Out of the 27 respondents, 18 companies—  including Intel—earned spots on the index. Survey shows increased  commitment to diversity and inclusion in the workforce. We will continue to  collaborate to expand the diverse pipeline of talent for our industry,  advance social equity, make technology fully inclusive, and expand  digital readiness.  Inclusive pipeline. Global education initiatives and STEM programs for girls and underrepresented. Intel works to expand the talent pipeline for underrepresented students. The company works with minority-serving institutions, including Hispanic-  serving institutions and historically Black colleges and universities. groups. Intel: Building a diverse and inclusive workforce and industry requires collective investments and innovative approaches. In 2023, Intel selected proposals from six institutions for three-year awards aimed at increasing diversity in semiconductor science and engineering higher education. Create a collective approach to reducing  emissions for the semiconductor manufacturing industry and increase  the use of technology to reduce climate impact in global manufacturing. Early GHG emissions reductions that cannot be considered in Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) target  validation criteria. It remains challenging to gain formal approval for our target under the current requirements of SBTi. To advance progress on  a collective approach, in 2023, we continued to engage via organizations  such as the Semiconductor. Intel is leading the way in Green Chemistry with our Chemical Footprint methodology. Climate Consortium to work to accelerate  reductions in GHG emissions in our industry. Launch a cross-industry R&D initiative to identify greener chemicals with lower global warming. ""We have implemented priority projects to address chemicals of concern and act on company commitments"" ""In 2023, as part of our  Supplier Program to Accelerate Responsibility and Commitment, we  asked our chemical suppliers to begin screening all R&D materials"" Intel has identified three ambitious global challenges where we believe we can best leverage our manufacturing expertise, unique position within the technology. We also continued to  collaborate through industry consortia to identify research needs and key  areas of focus, including reduction or elimination of PFAS. We will apply our expertise, resources, and technology to enable  others to harness the power of technology to improve health, safety,  and climate change. Click on the headers below for more detail on our approach and progress. Responsible Revolutionize how technology will improve health and safety. In 2023, we made progress on our global challenge to apply technology to advance healthcare and safety on multiple fronts. Building on previous  work to improve brain tumor detection with AI and Federated Learning,  Intel teamed up with MLCommons’ MedPerf to launch a platform revolutionizing the evaluation of brain tumor treatments. We also spent the last year collaborating with FarEasTone. Intel is working with Taiwan-based hospitals to build AI models to more accurately detect laryngeal cancer via an app exceeding 80% accuracy in diagnostic  results. Intel is a founding member of MLCommons AI Safety Workgroup where we will contribute expertise toward benchmarks to measure safety and risk factors. We will advance inclusion and accessibility for millions of people who  currently do not have the technology skills or resources needed to access educational, economic, and community resources. We aim to improve accessibility experiences each year on new key client  computing platforms with augmented features, capabilities, collabora­ tions, or services. By 2030, we aim to have all Intel user experience teams practicing inclusive design and research. To track our progress  toward that goal, we established an annual survey in 2022 with a baseline  adoption rate of 21%. In 2023, our adoption score decreased to 16.8%. Intel is committed to expanding digital readiness by collaborating with 30 country  governments and 30,000 institutions worldwide to empower more than 30 million people with AI skills for current and future jobs by 2030. As of  year-end 2023, Intel had collaborated with 28 governments with more than  50 public-private collaborations, enabled 24,000 institution, and trained more than 5.8 million people. Intel is working to reduce computing-related climate impacts across the rest of the global economy. Intel works closely with our OEMs to engage on a regular basis,  accelerating innovation in areas of joint priority. Intel will also take actions with others to collectively expand the  technology “handprint” In 2023, we introduced new requirements for OEMs manufacturing  the high-performance Intel Evo platforms, including independently verified ecolabel compliance.

Details on NOVs and our subsequent corrective actions are provided in the table below. Location Violation Fine Intel’s Corrective Action Ronler Acres,  Oregon The site performed a comprehensive review and implemented corrective actions. A boiler compliance test preliminary result showed an exceedance of the NOx Best Available Control  Technology limit. $0 Intel notified Maricopa County Air Quality Department, and completed a review of the event. The wastewater outfall pH fell below the limit due to incorrect valve positioning during a  maintenance activity. The event was reviewed, procedures were updated, and the site was returned to service. Intel submitted documentation to the CDPH demonstrating closure. The City of Austin Fire Department conducted an inspection and issued findings related to testing per the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standard. The Hillsboro Fire Department (HFD) issued a finding related to a  temporary e-waste disassembly area. A pH probe in one scrubber was inadvertently left in ""hold"" mode after preventative maintenance. The pH probe was immediately restored to the correct operating mode and the event was reported to the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. A review was performed to understand the root cause of the event and measures were implemented. The wastewater outfall fell below the limit due to low pH water that discharged from a section of piping after a tank diversion. A full review of the waste diversion process was conducted, and corrective actions were implemented. The site replaced back-up batteries, a smoke detector, and other items to prevent a reoccurrence. An anomaly was discovered in the external lab data for the copper levels at the wastewater outfall in Aloha, Oregon. The site conducted a review, updated plans, established automated wastewater constituent limit alerts with the lab, and performed an asset label audit. a part for a power supply. All exit signs were inspected and select ceiling tiles were replaced. An addendum was added to the lease contract for the site. The site conducted emergency response training and  hydrant light repairs. The government performed an inspection and issued a warning. The San Jose Fire Department performed an inspection and identified findings related to notification of a hand soldering station location change. The chemical inventory was updated and submitted to the fire department. The site is implementing the correct ratio of OHS employees to employed workers at the site.

The assessments are conducted by independent external advisors, in line with Tata Steel’s corporate social responsibility policy. The assessment is conducted to identify issues that present a risk or an opportunity to the Company. The last assessment for the Tata Steel Group was conducted in FY2022-23. Material issues pertaining to environmental and social matters were identified by Tata Steel, covering both risks and opportunities. Global standards, every 3 years, are updated to reflect the latest global standards.  significant part of Tata Steel’s production is through the blast furnace route, which is an emission intensive process. Tata Steel has committed to be Net Zero by 2045 and a  transition to low carbon steelmaking is critical for the long-term success of the Company. Tata Steel has taken concrete steps to transition to  green steelmaking. The detailed strategy to mitigate climate change-related risks is published in its Climate  Change Report. It is a part of Tata Steel Limited’s Integrated Report for FY2023-24. Tata Steel’s Initiatives Steel as a material lends itself handsomely  to circularity and is recyclable as ferrous  scrap to produce new steel. Recycled steel has a significantly lower carbon footprint,  as opposed to producing primary steel by reducing iron ore. Towards the target to be Net Zero by 2045, Tata Steel has increased  scrap usage in its steelmaking process. In India, Tata Steel has two approaches for value creation from circularity. The Industrial By-Products Management Division (IBMD) works to generate  value from by-products. The Steel Recycling Business (SRB) is responsible for sourcing and supplying. Tata Steel aims to maximise the amount of scrap charged into its existing blast furnace operations and the upcoming EAF-based green steel plant at Ludhiana, Punjab. In the Netherlands, Tata Steel plans to increase the percentage of scrap used in  steelmaking from 17% (in 2019) to 30% by 2030. Tata Steel’s water consumption is regulated in all geographies. In the UK, locally sourced scrap will be key for operating the proposed EAF. Tata Steel utilises a large amount of water in its processes and draws it from multiple sources. As a result of climate change, some geographies are expected to have reduced access to fresh water. To be cost-efficient, Tata Steel must minimise water usage and maximise recycling. compliance with regulatory requirements regarding effluent discharge and higher water usage may result in environmental compensation by regulatory authorities. In India, Tata Steel aims to achieve ZED (Zero  Effluent Discharge) from Works premises. Through the 4R framework of Reduce, Reuse, Recycle  and Recover, the company aims to reduce fresh water withdrawal to a minimum from rivers. Increased water recovery through an augmentation of the Central Effluent  Treatment Plant and sewage treatment plants as well as from storm   run-off streams. Adopting best available technologies like dry processes to reduce. and plans to build water   efficient infrastructure. Treatment effluents are reused for low-end applications like coke quenching, blast furnace slag granulation, steel slag quench, sinter/pellet  mixing, gas cleaning plant, horticulture, and dust suppression. Energy efficiency and management  initiatives help Tata Steel to manage and  optimise energy consumption across its operations. Tata Steel has lower operational  costs, greater resilience in the event of  energy disruptions, and a greater ability to respond to regulatory obligations. Energy efficiency and adoption of  renewable energy is also a key lever for  Tata Steel. Tata Steel already recovers a large part of its process gases to produce power and for heating purposes at all its geographies. Tata Steel is also working with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency in India to identify and  implement energy efficiency projects across various sites in India. Tata Steel also commissioned a floating solar power project with a capacity of 10.8  MWp (Megawatt peak) on its upper cooling pond in the Jamshedpur plant. In the Netherlands, Tata Steel, in alignment with the Dutch government, will source 379 MW of captive renewable power. In FY2023-24, Tata Steel Nederland reported 0.63 PJ of energy savings, equivalent  to 175 million kWh. The  biggest saving was achieved by a new, more efficient Hot Strip Mill furnace. The local ‘Noordzeekanaalgebied’  Environmental Agency has developed an energy savings agenda for 2024-2027. Tata Steel has a large number of employees  and contract workers working across all  sites. Many of the Company’s  steel plants are situated in close proximity  of the wider community (e.g., Jamshedpur,  IJmuiden, and Port Talbot).

Tata Steel believes in the ‘Zero Waste’ philosophy using the 3R (Reduce, Reuse & Recycle) circular economy principles. In a first-of-its-kind initiative in India, Tata Steel successfully recycled 12,000 tonnes of used refractories. To minimise the waste produced in the steelmaking process, Tata Steel has a dedicated profit centre for waste management. trial runs with its suppliers to switch  from high-speed diesel to alternate fuels, such as Liquefied Natural Gas.  steelmaking slags are the major by-products generated in the steel industry. Other  by-product include dust, sludge, mill scales, waste refractories, etc. The by- products are used in various external  applications (BF slag in cement manufacturing, metallics in secondary steelmaking, coal tar in coal tar pitch and Carbon Black) Tata Steel has invested in state-of-the-art technologies for processing by-products to maximise value creation. A few of the key facilities are as follows: Metal Recovery and Steam Ageing Plant, GCP (Gas  Cleaning Plant) sludge, LD slag fines, etc. IBD collects and processes internal scrap to maximise the scrap charge in steel melting. Non-metallic slag aggregates that undergo weathering at the steam ageing facility are used for civil or road construction. The fines are used as a cementitious material. A state-of-the-art facility equipped with a baling machine, specialised cut-to-length line, and a mechanised processing line for flat product arisings has been set up. The facility also houses an Innovation Lab to develop customised offerings to external customers. The slag generated during the ironmaking process in Blast Furnaces (BF slag) is divided into air-cooled slag and granulated slag. Granulated BF slag is sold to cement manufacturers, whereas  air- cooled slag  is processed and utilised in road construction.  GGBS (Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag) introduced to create additional value from BF slag. Can be used as a partial replacement for Ordinary  Portland Cement (OPC) in concrete production. Tata Steel GGBS is now available under the name ‘Tata Dureco’ While most processed solid waste is reutilised within the manufacturing process, Tata Steel partners with external agencies to dispose of hazardous waste in a secure landfill.

The initiatives under and product and process areas are summarised below. Refractory erosion in tundish limits the lining life and poses a  safety threat to productivity. A Fiber Bragg Grating-based sensor system has been developed and deployed to monitor real-time temperature. for Improving  Productivity  and  Safe  Operation. Online sinter size analysis acts as a proactive approach and early  warning indicator, which blast furnace operators need to maintain  the furnace’s stability. An image processing-based methodology is developed for estimating the sinter particle size distribution  in real time. The implemented system enables the blast furnace  operations team to take timely corrective action.  API X-65 Sour grade has been designed and produced at plant  scale. System enables blast  furnace operations team to take timely  corrective action for improving the efficiency of the furnace. The processed tubes exhibited excellent HIC (Hydrogen Induced Induced) A 3D printing wire feedstock is developed for large-scale additive manufacturing of structural steel applications. The work involved  designing alternative chemistry to attain continuously stable arc using low Si chemistry for a final tensile strength of a ≥500 MPa  equivalent to structural steel grades, e.g., Yst350.  ER100S-G MIG electrode (min. UTS 690 MPa) has been produced  in-house. The electrode finds applications for  joining advance high strength steels and strategically situates itself as a novel  product from an import substitution perspective. Rust preventive (RP) oil is applied over cold rolled steel to prevent temporary corrosion during transit and storage. The RP oil must  be removed from the customers’ end before post-painting. End- customers follow 7-tank pre-treatment processes to remove  oil, which involves hazardous chemicals. JSH590BN grade with more  than 100%-hole expansion  ratio. Technology is mainly developed for  cold rolled steel and can be directly applied without pre-treatment or primer coatings. The steel exhibited a superior surface finish due to its silicon-free chemistry. The material is produced by a Cr6+-free  production method. The material is consumer. manufacturing automotive components such as rear suspension beams that require  very high stretch flange ability during forming operation. TSN’s packaging  department developed and commercialised polymer coated TCCT  deep drawing material which led to a complete redesign of our customers food can. Glycol-based surface modifiers formulations have been deployed. These formulations stabilise the charge particles and prevents the re-agglomeration of particles during grinding. The work has resulted in 10% reduction in  ball mill rejects and 2% increase in ball mill  throughput at Pellet Plant. R&D has indigenously developed a metal oxide-based catalyst to improve the convective heat transfer. The catalyst addition resulted in increasing  the rate of sintering and reducing the coke rate at the Sinter Plant by 1.5 kg/tonne. Nickel and cobalt are critical minerals for India, and they have  ended use in stainless steel and batteries for the EV sector. A novel  pyrometallurgical process is developed to extract the nickel, cobalt,  iron and chromium metal values from chromite overburden. The solution comprises a machine learning algorithm that optimises the fan and pump speed based on ambient temperature and relative humidity as input factors. The proposed solution has resulted in  substantial improvements in energy efficiency, reductions in carbon dioxide  emissions, water savings, operational  expenses without causing any operational  disturbances. Tata Steel has commercialised a novel coking catalyst that reduces  coke production time. The innovation has the potential to produce an additional 50,000 tonnes of coke annually. It is a significant step  towards sustainable steel production. Tata Steel has developed a reagent which is extremely selective to aluminosilicates. This reagent through reverse iron ore flotation can lower alumina level from 5% in the feed to 3%. The pilot plant trial using the said reagent  is in progress. The process is now being tested at the  plant scale. The air bubble in the  flotation circuit gets coated with a thin layer of oil. This localised  presence of oil at the bubble interface lowers the energy barrier required for the three-phase attachment of the bubble with the particle. Sensor-based system provides real-time visualisation of the processes occurring inside the blast  furnace top. The system has empowered the operators to make interventions in raw material distribution that drastically improved the  furnace efficiency and brought down the  fuel rate.  system predicts the temperature in  the storage halls up to 5 days in advance and calculates when the  dew point is dangerously close to the temperature of the stored steel coils. If condensation is imminent, a warning is triggered. The groundbreaking system prevents corrosion, so fewer  rolls are rejected. The system is  unique in the manufacturing industry. as ores and  coal. In this way, delays in delivery to the  customers is avoided. Another advantage  lower energy consumption. Various developments on the blast furnace process, including  modelling and experimental testing of ceramic materials. Using Artificial Intelligence to optimise ladle logistics. Minimising heat loss during the transfer of hot metal reduces direct CO2 emissions. Allows scrap intake to be increased. Tata Steel has an Onsite Emergency Plan and Disaster Control measure in place. Under the plan, there are defined responsibilities for every group and all individuals involved in handling emergencies. Tata Steel has also established Tactical Centres to ensure business continuity during emergencies. The practices have been benchmarked  against best practices at other organisations with mature Business Continuity Management practices. Continuity Plans (BCPs) are in place, and include details of crisis/continuity management teams, disaster response procedures, and communications as appropriate. The BCPs are closely linked with risk management at  Tata Steel Nederland and combine both risk management and impacts to usual business processes. Tata Steel has one of the most complex value chains in the industry. Group Strategic Procurement & Supply Chain manages sourcing and logistics for 60 MTPA raw materials and 20 MTPA finished goods. There has been no significant adverse impact arising from the value chain of Tata Steel.

Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21

Dear fellow stakeholders,
Welcome to our","Wipro Sustainability Report FY 2020-21 is published by Wipro. The report is presented in three parts. The Executive Chairman’s Letter to stakeholders is the first part of the report. The second part is the Executive Summary and the third is the Report Profile. The last two years have been unprecedented in recent human history. Except during the two world wars, there has probably never been a time when entire populations have had to stay inside. There are several redeeming features we should perhaps be grateful for. Without Covid. vaccines in a remarkably short time, our collective recovery would have been severely impaired. Equally if not more  noteworthy has been the exceptional humanitarian response from our civil society. Azim Premji Foundation and Wipro have been in the forefront of this. The Foundation has been engaged in the stupendous task of ensuring that the vaccination rollout reaches underserved populations in different parts of rural India. Through a carefully planned and diligently executed collaborative  effort with 3900 Primary Healthcare Centers, the program has enabled the public system to fully vaccinate  110 million people across 24 states. Digital technology has played a key role in the fight against the pandemic. If not for cloud-powered digital connectivity, large parts of our economy would have come to a halt. For a company like ours with 230,000+ employees and customers across the globe, it is only because of. ‘Digital’ fatigue and related mental health issues stemming from  long periods of isolation and endless virtual meetings. As we get employees back to a new hybrid mode of. cloud and digital technologies that not only were we able to ensure continuity of  our operations but also serve our customers more strategically.’ Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21 4. Global attention last year also prioritized (as it must) climate change. The COP26 conference in Glasgow in November saw a rising groundswell of commitments to Net Zero emissions from governments and business. In work, we must do so with empathy and sensitivity. ""We have been very categorical  from the beginning that the journey and pathway to Net Zero is as important as the destination. For us, this  essentially means achieving deep decarbonization to the extent of at least 90% in our operations and value chain,"" he says. ""Our approach was validated when in October, we were one of the first 7 companies in the world to have our Net Zero targets,"" he adds. We are also actively involved in climate change advocacy through global forums like ‘Transform  to Net Zero’ and World Economic Forum. One key  concern I would like to call out is that as the world transitions to a greener tomorrow, we must make sure it is just and fair to all concerned, especially to vulnerable communities. We must realize that climate change is a part of a larger set of critical societal challenges–biodiversity loss, water scarcity, urban stress, inadequate livelihoods, inequitable access to education and healthcare, and loss of social cohesiveness. As corporations like us, what that  means is that the renewable energy we procure must be from responsible producers wherein vulnerable  communities have not been displaced or otherwise affected. In 2020, investment  companies pledged to nearly USD 103 trillion of Assets under ESG Management. This sharp uptick in  investor interest in ESG is welcome as it will drive. responsible members  of society, corporations must engage with these issues in a deep, systemic manner. We have long held that comprehensive and transparent sustainability reporting can lead to a virtuous cycle of improvements and transformation for the company. We were one of the early adopters of the UN Global  Compact principles and the GRI reporting framework. We have also been active participants in investor-led  frameworks like CDP and DJSI of which we have been a 12-time running member. ""The need to rationalize and  simplify the plethora of ESG standards will greatly help accelerate the adoption ofESG by a much larger  set of companies,"" he says. ""Regulators, investors and businesses must  come together and address this need on an urgent basis,"" he adds. I started this letter by talking about the humanitarian nature of the Covid crisis and ended it by highlighting the trend of investor engagement on sustainability. This broad sweep of themes says something about the changing nature of  the world we live in today. A world that is interconnected as much through markets,  trade and digital tools as through viral pandemics. Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21 6 Executive Summary. In this summary, we present the organization’s contextual background, the diversity of our programs, and its embedding into core organization processes. The core principles underlying our engagement. play the most important role in holding us  together as we navigate our way into the future.

Our new strategy will bring us  closer to clients, drive greater agility and responsiveness and help us become the employer of choice. ""We are informed by global sustainability trends that are likely to impact the emerging business and socio- economic landscape"" ""We have undertaken a comprehensive Climate Change Risk  Assessment Program for our major operational locations across the globe. This has been carried out for  two scenarios (based on the IPCC defined RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) covering medium to long term"" The significant risks we see are from the possibility of increase disruption to operations due  to extreme weather events, especially in coastal cities in India. Infrastructure damage, employee absence  and productivity loss are all likely impacts of such climate change induced events. Our mitigation strategy comprises a robust business continuity plan and appropriate infrastructure insurance. We are a founding member of the ‘Transform to Net Zero’ initiative.

Business responsibility is about the organization fulfilling  its duties and responsibilities. Sustainability is about ensuring that the organization is able to meet its goals and objectives. The Board Governance, Nomination and Compensation Committee is headed by an independent director. It acts as the CSR Committee - an apex body that oversees Wipro’s sustainability.

Sustainability reporting should aim to be a faithful reflection of the organization’s values, vision, plans,  progress and challenges on the different dimensions of sustainability. Determining ‘materiality’ helps an  organization to understand issues that are relevant to its. Materiality is informed by stakeholders over the short, medium and long  term. The process must be centered  at the intersection of organizational relevance and stakeholder priorities. This understanding, in turn, makes sustainability strategy and action more in tune with stakeholder  priorities. The driving principle is to keep ‘ears to the ground’ by understanding  stakeholders’ perceptions and expectations, the business context, local and macro developments and  changing thresholds of sustainability risks and opportunities over time. In addition to the classic framework that maps issues based on ‘Relevance to the Organization’ and  ‘ re-examining’ the ‘driving principle’ is also important. Material dimensions vary from one organization to another as the context of each company and the industry or geography in which it is operating is not necessarily the same. The issues faced by a business can be different even within the same sector and geography. The materiality determination should reflect the complexities of multiple environmental, social and economic issues. It is also important to look at the probability and impact of the issues over a long period of time. The societal  and global context could shift and what would have been peripheral in the short term could eventually  become central and critical. The conventional materiality matrix typically places issues based on  relevance to the company and relevance to individual stakeholder. ‘Stakeholder relevance’ is an abstract, macro notion unless it is mapped to the next level of  detail to the individual stakeholder. In the conventional materiality matrix of ‘Relevance to Wipro’ and ‘ relevance  to Stakeholders’, certain critical sustainability issues may not score high on either of these. The new framework will look at all these three factors. The questions ‘Who are your stakeholders?’ and ‘What are their material issues?' are important starting steps. Based  on GRI G4 Guidelines and AA 1000 principles of ‘Stakeholder Inclusiveness’, ‘Materiality’ Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21 42 Stakeholder Identification. ‘Sustainability  Context’, we have adopted the following approach to determine materiality for our company. Wipro and S sustainability: A Strategic Overview. We identified the attributes of stakeholders that make them important to business and necessitate meaningful engagement. These led us to identify the following eight stakeholder groups. Readers will note that, except for minor  semantic differences, all of these groups are the same. The materiality recalibration exercise essentially reaffirmed our earlier decision in this regard. While the first four have. differences, these are the same stakeholders that appear in our previous reports. The Young Citizen and Future Generation are the most important. Wipro has taken a threefold approach based on the Five Part Materiality Test. Material issues and their relative importance to Wipro and our stakeholders are not static and are likely to change with time. We try to present a 360-degree perspective on our business and ecosystem. A significant part of materiality determination stems from the organization’s overall mission, values,  commitments and competitive strategy. An internal perspective on risks as identified through organizational processes like risk assessment studies and audits is also considered in the process. Listed below are the sources of information. Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21 43 External Benchmarking  We conducted an extensive review of literature to identify issues considered as material and identified as risks by our business. Wipro and Sustainable: A Strategic Overview WIPro S sustainability report FY 2020-21. 43 External benchmarking issues. Stakeholder inclusiveness is central to the materiality determination process. It is important to consider reasonable expectations and interests of stakeholders to provide a balanced view. Listed below are the sources of information to understand expectations expressed in international standards and agreements. At Wipro, we engage with our stakeholders regularly to understand their concerns and develop plans to  address those concerns. From the above-mentioned sources, a universe of all issues or dimensions that could be material for our  businesses was identified. Waste Diversity Energy Employee Health, Safety and Wellbeing. Urban resilience Fair Labor Practice. Water Talent Attraction, Development and retention. Natural and man-made catastrophes. Open Source Data Privacy. IT system security and operational resilience.

Corruption, Bribery, Corporate Fraud Regulatory compliance Customer Satisfaction  Supply chain management. Intellectual Property Rights Innovation Transparency and disclosure Service Delivery Outsourcing related issues Data Security Tax strategy Stakeholder communication. In 2014-15, we identified issues that had a materiality to our business and industry. Following this, a prioritization exercise was undertaken by looking  at the intrinsic worth of each issue as well as its relative priority. The stakeholder’s feedback was also taken  into account by incorporating their ratings for each of these dimensions against four criteria. The company held a formal consultation with senior leadership, employees and external sustainability experts. Since then, we have revisited the materiality matrix/map each year, and consider  any refresh that it requires, based on latest stakeholder feedback and input. GRI standard requires reporting to focus on ‘what matters’ and ‘where it matters' We undertook an exercise to determine the most material issues to include in this report from multiple dimensions of risk,  returns and relevance. We adopted the following steps to identify material aspects for reporting. 20 topics have been finalized for reporting. Depending on the relative importance, the other issues identified will be detailed in the respective sections. The outcomes of the process were shared with all relevant functions for review and the consequent feedback was incorporated. Given below is the mapping of identified aspects and topics to Business continuity and obsolescence are typical concerns for the technology sector. Ensuring  continued meaningful employment for employees and creating opportunities for external talent are important focus areas. respective sections and primary stakeholders. Stakeholders What is  material? Where does the  impact occur? Why is the topic material? Health and Safety performance is a key measure of an organization’s duty of care.

India is one of the worst-performing countries on Economic  participation and opportunity subindex. Electricity contributes to around 20% of global energy needs and is predominantly fossil fuel driven. Travel and commute contribute to 69% of total environmental impact. Transition to renewables in  a just and equitable manner is critical. The development trajectory over the past many decades – especially in the developed economy, including China has largely been energy and emissions intensive. To limit the worse negative impact of climate  change, it is critical to limit the temperature  increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre- industrial levels by the end of this century. Water Operations in  India as they constitute  80% of overall  footprint and contribute to 69% of environmental impact. World Economic Forum’s Global Risk Report 2021 continues to identify natural resources, which  includes water, as one of the top high impact  risks. UN-Water (2018) forecasts that 2  billion people live in countries or regions which  experience high water stress. 700 million  people worldwide could be displaced by intense  water scarcity by 2030.  reduction of waste and effluents can  contribute directly to lower costs for materials,  processing and disposal.

The 2030 targets include eradication, economic growth education, health, social protection, climate change, environmental protection. Given the ambitious nature of the targets for 2030, magnitude of efforts required to achieve them and the  scale of challenge, it is not possible to achieve the goals without meaningful partnership between different stakeholders. Businesses - as drivers of economic growth and employment and a source of finance,  technology and innovation - is a key stakeholder and it has great potential.

Extreme weather events, urban water  stress, air pollution, waste management and their impacts on employee health and wellbeing are the most  material issues we engaged with. In 2020, we completed a comprehensive climate change risk assessment program, encompassing both  physical and transitional risks. This has been carried out for two scenarios (based on the IPCC defined RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) covering medium to long term (2030-2050) timeframes. In both scenarios, we see increased probability of higher incidence of water stress, and heat waves across cities. Business Continuity Policy prescribes principles to plan for climatic disruptions which could disrupt business objectives. Risk assessment exercise is undertaken at both the company level and at the asset level. We are in the process of incorporating the findings of the study into our BCP and Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. The CBCMT. Team (CBCMT) governs and guides the standard  risk assessment methodology at every location. This group collaborates with various support groups in the organization to assess risks  for human resources, facilities & IT infrastructure with identified impacts and their probability/likelihood. The detailed climate modelling and impact assessment exercise will help  in further calibrating our risk management program. A severity matrix of Low, Medium & High impacts is defined, and an identified crisis management group is vested with the responsibility to respond, recover, resume, return & restore from these situations. We have committed to Net Zero goals by 2040,  with absolute emissions reduction of 55% by 2030. These are aligned  with the objectives of the Paris agreement to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius. Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21 69. Achieve EPI (Energy Performance Index) of 125 KwH per sq. mt by 2025. 2 absolute emissions level of 80,000 tons by 2030 from 2017 baseline. Renewable Energy (RE)- renewable energy procurement   to 110 million tons. The plan is to reduce Scope 3 emissions for Business Travel, Employee commute and Upstream fuel and energy related emissions by 55% by 2030. As a first principle, we will defer carbon removal projects (offsets)  to the net zero target year (2040) The absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions (India) for FY 2021 has decreased by 29% from  137,930 tons to 97,348. This is due to low occupancy and resultant lesser conditioned area. Over the next few months, we will evolve a detailed plan for the same. India office space emissions intensity (Scope 1 and Scope 2) is at 108 Kg CO2 eq. per  Sq. Mt. per annum, up by %24 from FY 2020. The figures are net emissions for all years, after considering zero emissions for renewable  energy procured. The overall energy consumption from Scope 1 and 2 boundaries (operational and  financial control) are 661.5 million Mjoules. This is a decrease of 27.7%. The total energy consumption - electricity and diesel-based backup power - for office  spaces in India is 151.3 million units. For India operations, about 64.85 million units constitute renewable energy. Of these, 60.7 million units is with green attributes. Data centers in India contribute another 22.9 million  units. Though the occupancy is low (average of 5%), the building air conditioning, lighting and allied electrical systems would not be reduced in the same proportion. Around 70% of the energy  consumption for offices is from air conditioning system. Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21 70 (zero emissions) Another 13 million units is attributable to air conditioning systems in offices and other buildings. EPI for company-owned office spaces, measured in terms of energy per unit area has  been increased to 194.7 KwH units per sq. meter per annum. In total, the renewable energy footprint in our portfolio is 73.7 million units. Our total scope 3 emissions for FY 21-2020 are 354706 tons of CO2 eq, which accounts  for 78% of our total footprint. Out of   the 15 categories of scope 3 reporting as per the new GHG corporate  value chain standard, we are currently report on all the 8 categories applicable to us. Work From Home emissions are based on material group and category spend for Tier 1 suppliers. If  we include all tiers, the emissions are estimated to be around 500,000 tons. We aim to engage with top suppliers (contributing to 80% of impact) to arrive at the next level of detail. 93% of the employees in India and 90% overseas worked from their places of  resident. We have estimated the emissions due to WFH scenario for FY21, and have included in our Scope  3 emissions portfolio. The total emissions due to WFH globally is estimated at 36,230 tons of Co2 eq, with the US contributing  to 36% and the UK to 13%. We have considered the number of employees working from home across the following geographies – ANZ and APAC, EMEA; LATAM & North America to calculate WFH emissions. The overall GHG emissions across all scopes is 447,683 tonnes. India contributing to 23%. Though 80% of the employees are based in India, its contribution to emissions is less due to significant lower energy intensity per capita compared to other countries. Wipro's five-year GHG mitigation plan consists of three key elements – Energy Efficiency (Reduce), Renewable Energy (RE) Purchase (Replace) and Business Travel Substitution. Of this, RE procurement will contribute the maximum, 80% share to GHG emission mitigation strategy. The Global Energy command center aggregates  Building Management System inputs on a common platform to optimize operational control and improve energy efficiency. measures include new retrofit technologies to improve Chiller and Air Handling  Units (AHUs), integrated design and monitoring platforms. As of March 2021, we have 13133 virtual servers (10155 in March 2020) running on 758 physical servers. This contributes to an energy savings of approximately 57.9 million units in the reporting year. The savings showed an increase of 21% over the previous year. Thin clients being used in one of our locations, which consumes less energy (80% less) compared to Desktop, resulting in savings of 1.2 million units. have enabled 9,333 VDI’s  to end users across locations. Due to the pandemic, the business travel footprint was 11% and  employee commute was 21% of the previous year’s footprint. This includes (i) travel by air, bus, train, local conveyance and hotel stays for the category of business travel and (ii) personal cars two wheelers, public transport and Wipro arranged transport for employee commute. Covid is the first major Indian business to encourage carpooling. The company has taken steps to facilitate improved access to public transport for employees. In the reporting year, we had negligible carpooling trips due to majority of employees working from home as well as the requirements of Covid.

Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21 72 Water Responsibility. Contribute to deeper understanding of systemic challenges of urban water in the major cities in India. To ensure responsible water management in proximate communities, especially in locations that are prone to water scarcity. Freshwater consumption has seen a drop of 47.5% from last year. Recycled water generation was 407.5 million liters, with a recycling ratio of 32%. Due to the low average occupancy of our offices, the per capita consumption of water is not comparable. Consequently, the freshwater  area intensity at 1.094 KL per square meter has shown a marginal increase of 4.8% compared to the earlier  year. We have achieved 12.5% reduction in absolute freshwater consumption from FY16 till the previous  year FY20. Our water is derived from four sources – private water (mainly ground water delivered  by tanker water suppliers), municipal water, water supplied by industry associations, in-situ ground water and harvested rainwater. The first two sources account for nearly 94% of the sourced water. Ground water contributes  to nearly 46% of our total freshwater consumption across cities in India. 94% of the  total water is from areas (cities) in water stressed basins. The water supplied by the municipal bodies is  sourced primarily from river or lake systems. Private water (mainly Ground water)  41.7%  Municipal and industry bodies  54%  Ground water  4.3%  Rainwater  1%  Water recycling:   With ever-increasing pressure on water supplies, the government authorities (PCB) have mandated companies to achieve zero liquid discharge in their operations. Water efficient fixtures, waste water treatment technologies, rain water harvesting and smart metering for monitoring. Ultrafiltration (UF) and  Membrane bioreactor (MBR) system has been installed in the city. Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21 73. UF/MBR permeate water is used for flushing and landscape. The final stream from UF / MBR is been sent  to reverse-osmosis system. This water is ideal for Cooling Requirement. Around 3% of treated water is  discharged to municipal sewer. Long-term projects on Urban Water in cities are providing key policy insights and levers for citizen engagement and advocacy. We bring together hydrogeologists, academia, government,  citizen groups for a nuanced approach to ground water management and its relationships to surface water flows and  water bodies. The program will also monitor  and estimate the groundwater (shallow aquifer) potential for city, and recommend suggested practices for better. The program is backed up by targeted advocacy work through. case-studies, engagement  with the city utility administrators and the development of national guidelines. In Pune we are building a first of its kind city level data,interpretation and decision support platform for ground water management. In Chennai, through the small grants program we are supporting community-based interventions on water. In Hyderabad, we are putting together a knowledge repository. We aim to bring together all our work on a common learning platform for urban water. 100% of organic waste generated from business operations is recycled for effective reuse. To ensure by 2025 more than 98% of. of water in the city is recycled. Pollution of air and water poses one of the most serious threats to community health and societal welfare. Managing these ‘commons’ in an urban context requires business organizations to look beyond its own boundaries and adopt an integrated approach. Other categories of waste is recycled as per appropriate  national standards with less than 2% reaching landfill.

All  of these meet the specified regulatory norms. Biodiversity projects integrate multiple benefits of water conservation, ambient temperature reduction, air pollution mitigation and employee engagement. We are actively engaged in several forums that advance advocacy on climate change and other related  environmental impacts. Bengaluru Sustainability Forum (BSF) was set up in early 2018 and convened by Wipro along with the National Center for  Biological Sciences. This year, due to the pandemic, all the outreach was cut short. The forum’s Climate Change working group, ‘Business for Nature’ coalition, ‘CII Greenco’ and ‘India Climate  Collaborative’. In the year,  we hosted a reading and discussion series on the UN sustainable goals. Called ‘Reading for change’, the seriescurated conversations with authors of six leading books. We also hosted a workshop on the food economy of Bangalore in association with Bangalore International Centre. Wipro’s Natural Capital Valuation Program is a rigorous framework that assesses and quantified impacts - positive and  negative - on nature or natural capital. Impacts are calculated across six key performance indicators (KPIs) namely, GHG emissions, air pollution,  water. The methodology uses a value for the social cost of carbon that varies by country and geography. It uses a higher  discount rate for developing countries as compared to developed countries. For calculating impacts due to air pollution only human health Impacts were considered as they contribute  to 95% of total impact from air pollution. In FY2021, the total environmental costs related to Wipro’s operations and supply chain were quantified at  $0.20 billion. For calculating impact  due to water consumption, the following factors were taken into consideration – impact on human health, incidence of infectious disease and impact of energy consumption. Of the operational impacts, the highest contribution is from  electricity consumption at 80% ($12.8 million) Within Wipro’s upstream supply chain, purchased goods  and services across all tiers of suppliers (88%; $161 million) and fuel and energy related activities (12%;  $22 million) are the top two impact categories.  pollution (57%; $117.6  million), greenhouse gas emissions (30%; $60 million) are the top two contributors. Natural capital impacts  as % share of Revenue of Wipro operation is 2.5% (2.9%  in FY20) As % share EBIT is  12.2% (14.8% in  FY20).  Ecological Sustainability Customer  Stewardship Wipro helps businesses thrive in a world defined by disruption and fuelled by transformative technology. We anticipate that our ‘Digital first’ strategy will be particularly relevant as we  believe the following consumer and industry trends will reshape the way businesses and organizations operate.  COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated the shift to online/Digital business models globally, across industries and markets. Ecosystem collaboration  will become a key element of business strategy, and will be driven by the need to optimize for time, cost and de-risking imperatives. Virtual, remote, community-based and distributed work models  such as work from home/remote working will become mainstream, enabled by remote working and collaborative technologies. We believe that in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, mainstream adoption of the community work  force and crowdsourced and community models (private, private, public) will become more common.  Enterprises will need to evaluate their technology stack to allow them to operate with flexibility and agility. Social distancing will become a key ‘design principle’ element from an  operating model standpoint across businesses. The adoption of public and hybrid technology will accelerate.

Our annual financial report and the Form 20-F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange commission for  the reporting year lists several external factors or risks that may impact our business. These externalities  are assessed regularly and inform business strategy. We present here a summary of the key external risks identified and our approach towards them. We derive approximately 59% of our IT Services segment  revenue from the Americas (including the United States) and 27% ofOur IT Servicesgment revenue from Europe. Our business and financial performance is and will continue to be affected by economic  conditions globally. Increased protectionism and the risk of global trade war, If the economy in the Americas or  Europe continues to be volatile or uncertain or conditions in the global financial market deteriorate,  pricing for our services may become less attractive. Reduction in spending on IT services may  lower the demand for our Services and negatively affect our business. Our profits for the period earned from providing services at client premises outside  India are subject to tax in the country where we perform the work. Most of our taxes paid in countries  other than India can be applied as a credit against our Indian tax liability to the extent that the same income is subject to taxation in India. Wage costs in India have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in  the U.S. and Europe for comparably skilled professionals. Changes to  these incentives and other exemptions we receive due to government policies can impact our financial  performance. We have historically experienced significant competition for employees from large multinational companies that have established and continue to establish  offshore operations in India, as well as from companies within India. We may need to increase the levels  of our employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to retain talent. Once the effective date is  notified, we will notify our employees. Wage increases may reduce our profit margins. We may also experience increased costs in future years for employment and post- employment benefits in India. Unless  we are able to continue to increase the efficiency and productivity of our employees over the long term. Europe,  China or Southeast Asia could also negatively affect our profits.

Investors expect ethical conduct from businesses. They are concerned about loss of management time and  resources dealing with such issues, legal liability and damage to reputation. Corruption and bribery are significant risks to businesses, and they are more pervasive in the supply chain. This makes business functions dealing with suppliers and business partners vulnerable to such risks. Wipro’s corporation wide Code of Business Conduct (COBC) provides broad direction for all business transactions. The COBC  Financial Stewardship and Investors Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21 90 applies to all employees and members of the Board of Directors of the Company, as also to all individuals who serve the Company on contract, subcontract, retainer, consultant or any other such basis. Channel partners (dealers, distributors and others) serve  as an extension of the Company and their conduct and behavior while carrying out business dealings with Wipro can have an impact on the company's reputation. Other than COBC, we also have  other policies like the abridged Policy on Related Party Transactions, WIPro Supplier Code of Conduct, Code  of Independent Directors and Code of Ethics for Principal Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers. Wipro has the following processes internally to ensure an ethical culture across our businesses. A payment due diligence process where payments made by and on behalf of Wipro are reviewed to ensure  adherence to anti-corruption and anti-bribery. A Standard Operating Procedure to enable employees understand and comply with the requirements for  specific purposes like business. Employees are advised to avoid transactions which might give the appearance of offering or accepting  an improper payment, bribe or kickback. Due diligence mechanisms, internal controls and assessments on its third parties such as channel partners, dealers, collection agents, lead finders/hunters etc. Wipro has an Ombuds process for receiving and redressing employees’ complaints. Employees are encouraged to report any fraudulent financial or other information to the stakeholders. As part of COBC training, Wipro trains employees on anti-bribery policies. The company. conducts entry-level training to all its employees across levels worldwide on  corporate policies pertaining to Business Relationship, Gifts and Entertainment, Business Courtesies and  Conflict of Interest. Compliance with Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act, the Indian Prevention  of Corruption Act, are included as part of leadership training programs. Wipro has a continuing good track of ethical conduct, and we comply with relevant legislations. There have  been no significant instances related to bribery, corruption, anti-competitive or anti-trust practices in the  reporting period across our business divisions. The impacts or externalities of businesses are frequently influenced by their supply chain processes. Managing the environmental and social impacts of supply chain are interlinked to economic outputs over the long term. They can help businesses avoid disruptions, meet evolving customer and business partner requirements, foster innovation and protect the environment. Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21 92 supply chain sustainability. Sustainability engagement in our value chain stems from our belief that it is the right thing to do in the larger interests of both the suppliers as well as of society. It can also help further the business imperatives of efficiency, cost effectiveness and resilience in the supply chain. The supplier ecosystem of Wipro can be broadly categorized into two broad heads. One category can be called as our ‘primary supply chain’ which comprises of our contract employees involved in core delivery of IT Services and Solutions. Such employees typically have gone through a minimum of three years of training. ‘Secondary supply chain’ comprises of suppliers who provide products, business support services and utility management services for our operations. We considered them as part of our supply chain as they are not engaged  directly/employed by Wipro. Facility management requires a diverse set of support services. A significant number of contract manpower is employed as  part of these facilities. Wipro is an Equal Opportunity employer and strongly advocates the same through its supply chain by  encouraging supplier diversity. Wipro has a formal process to identify suppliers who are strategic to its sustained business performance. The suppliers are classified into two categories: Strategic suppliers and Tactical suppliers. The Global  Procurement Group finalizes the supplier categorization. Wipro is restructuring its vendor empanelment process to help strengthen our supplier diversity process. Sustainability or other serious issues with such suppliers may seriously dent Wipro’s ability to meet  its objectives. Strategic Suppliers are suppliers which are essential for the success of strategic business outcomes. Tactical Supplier account for only a small part of the overall spend of Wipra. The Enterprise Risk Management function  owns the supplier economic risk assessment process. The focus is on ensuring continuous and  non-interrupted supply of services/goods. Vendor Risk Assessment comprises a formal evaluation of a  Supply Chain Sustainability Wipro Sustainable Report FY2020-21 93 vendor company’s financial health. The Group Sustainability Function partners with Central Procurement Organization, Facilities Management  Group and other relevant stakeholders in identifying environmental and social risks in Wipro’s supply chain. Independent studies are conducted periodically. The Ombuds process is also available for suppliers through a 24X7 hotline and on the internet.

The understanding of risks in the supply chain and our stakeholders’ concerns informed the outcomes of  our materiality determination exercise. Based on the identified risks, we have gauged the following aspects as material from a sustainability perspective. We refer to our high proportion of contract staff - both, people involved in core delivery as well as skilled or  unskilled support staff who work in campus operations as ‘people supply chain’ In this section, we will primarily  address the secondary supply chain as the ‘ people supplyChain’ aspect has been covered in detail in ‘Workplace  Sustainability’ section of our website. Human Rights Assessment Supplier Assessment for Impacts on society (Corruption, Anti-competition) Procurement Practices. Wipro's supply-chain approach is based on the principles of ethics and integrity, ecological sustainability and workplace responsibility. Wipro expects its suppliers to adhere to similar standards of Ethics and integrity as its own standards. We expect suppliers to supply products and services that exceed environmental standards. Wipro expects its suppliers to adhere to principles of human rights, employee welfare, health and safety, minimum wages and fair working hours. We encourage sourcing from the  local economy and supplier diversity. The responsibility of managing procurement related activities of Wipro rests with the Global Procurement  Group. The responsibility is divided among multiple buyer groups who handle different  procurement categories. The Procurement Group works along with Enterprise Risk Management, Internal  Audit and Legal teams to ensure compliance and to proactively address risks in the supply chain. At Wipro, we are committed to delivering. quality products and services on a timely  basis, consistent with organizational objectives and policies. Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21 95 Policy & Guiding. Wipro. believe that a supply chain program should consider the socio-economic realities in the geographies where we operate. The supply chain sustainability charter should go beyond legal compliance and take into consideration emergent debates and issues. Our Code of Business Conduct (COBC) provides the ethical guidelines and expectations for conducting  business on behalf of Wipro. COBC is applicable to all suppliers, agents, service providers, channel partners, dealers, distributors and vendors (‘Suppliers’) The SCOC covers key risks in the supply chain like forced or compulsory labor. The code is aligned with the requirements of the  FCPA (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and the UK anti-bribery act. The document also gives an overview of the process followed by Wipro so that it can comply with the code. The SCOC is  communicated to all suppliers, and it is mandatory for suppliers to accept and sign it. Wipro also has a procurement policy which acts as an internal decision-making guide related to procurement. This policy details the procurement principles that the Global Procurement Group is expected to adhere to. Program is informed by four guiding principles: Understanding Socio-economic context. In developing economies, supplier staff may not be aware of the nuances of human and labor rights. In certain cases, the practice may be due  to livelihood issues – for example, excessive overtime. Children in family owned or sole proprietorship could sometimes be employed (or  ‘helping’ in the business. Enforcement of unilateral actions in such cases does not change the practice  on the ground but only diverts attention from the problem at hand. In many cases, our visibility is limited to  the first one or two tiers. For supply chain entities not critical or strategic to us, our ability to influence supplier practices is much more limited. It would be naïve of us to claim compliance across all the tiers. The impact of the supply chain on different  stakeholders is dependent on the nature of business and operational context. Industry bodies and large government procurement programs have a larger role in influencing change. The compliance requirements of one supplier category can vary from another. At Wipro, we try to uphold all the regulations and wherever there is a  conflict, our best efforts are to minimize any dissonance. Managing supply chain externalities is of  key interest to business due to the deepening of complexities in the supply chain. Industry forums like Sedex, Ecovadis , CDP Supply Chain are  working towards indirectly driving continuous change in ethical and responsible business practices. Dow Jones Sustainability Index and CDP are increasingly giving importance to the supply chain performance of organizations. Our Supply Chain engagement has been a journey where sustainability has increasingly become central. Our engagement approach is multi-pronged with the focus on improving the capabilities of suppliers in managing their sustainability performance. Manpower service providers in civil, operations and support  services are a key part of our supply chain.  suppliers who provide utility products and services (electricity, water, waste management) and ICT equipment have large environmental footprints. A significant feature of our engagement is how we align our community or CSR (Corporate Social  Responsibility) programs with supplier engagement wherever it is possible. Education for children of migrant laborers for new infrastructure projects, urban water programs in cities where we operate are some examples. Educate suppliers on environmental,  social, and governance  best practices to be  incorporated into their business. Engage with the suppliers to  improve their capabilities in managing  their suppliers. Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21 97 Programs & Process Our supplier engagement program integrates a process of continuous evaluation, capacity building and risk  management. Wipro expects these steps to encourage sustainability performance for our customers and partners. Wipro's supplier code of conduct must be mandatorily signed by all suppliers at the time of onboarding. A dedicated vendor helpdesk handles supplier issues. Wipro has a focus on human rights, labor practices and regulatory compliance. Helpdesk had a two-day SLA resolution percentage of 99.99% with respect to vendor queries in the reporting year. The feedback from our vendors received through this initiative helped us improve our processes and initiate new steps, like automation of sharing payment advices. Wipro’s Ombudsman process allows and encourages any affected  stakeholder including suppliers and contractors to report breaches of the COBCE and any other matter of  integrity to the Ombudsman concerned. While a good proportion of Ombuds process cases are anonymous,  based on self-disclosure. A sensitization program  was conducted, and expectations have been conveyed formally through our contracting process. It is compulsory for all our vendors to acknowledge and accept the Wipro Supplier Code of Conduct (SCOC) High Risk Vendors (HRV) identified based on geography, nature of service and engagements where they  interact with. There were 6 complaints reported by suppliers during the year. HRV vendors are required to submit an anti-bribery anti- corruption questionnaire. Government on behalf of Wipro go through additional checks and balances during processing. We also have requirements of stricter negotiating threshold, clear break up of costs and  multiple quotes regardless of the value. Wipro adopted the EPEAT standard from Green Electronic Council in 2016 for its IT hardware procurement. Most of the impacts are concentrated down the value chain of Wipro’s direct suppliers. We engage  with tier 1 suppliers in improving their sustainability performance so that they are able to cascade these  practices down their supply chain. In 2020, we purchased more than 10,000+ EPEAT certified y products across desktops, laptops, displays,  imaging equipment and mobiles. In tangible terms, our procurement of EPEat certified hardware translates into a saving of 1.5 million kWh of energy over the lifetime of products. Till date we have migrated 20000 users from traditional physical desktop to Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) across 5. Through proactive maintenance and upgrades, we have been able to reutilize 18% of the assets – desktops, laptops and thin clients post their scheduled end of life. This has led to reduction in energy  consumption, easier operations and cost saving. Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21 99 Partnering for Social Change. Social initiatives center on the following dimensions- Education, Community Care and Ecology. The programs on ecology are covered in the ‘Ecological Sustainability’ section. We engage with communities on issues that matter most to them in a deep and meaningful manner with long-term commitment. School education in India, outside India and outside the country. Sustainability education, technology education and Talent Next Community Care. Addressing environmental issues like energy, water, solid waste and biodiversity. Social responsibility and sustainability rests on three important principles. Social responsibility is as much about being a sustainable organization as it is about external initiatives. Some of our areas of engagement lie at the convergence of  business goals and social purpose. Within the chosen domains, we choose to engage with systemic issues that require deep,  meaningful and challenging work. The emphasis on depth and on long term commitment implies a deliberative approach. This precludes spreading ourselves thin or engaging in ‘cheque book philanthropy’ This also means that we are wary of expanding and growing our social programs as ends in themselves.

The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Expenditure / CSR Spend as disclosed in the Director’s Report of  the Annual Report 2020-21 is Rs. 2,512 Mn. Wipro Foundation is a public charitable trust created in 2017 to manage corporate citizenship.  foundation has a robust governance process led by a 5-member board of trustees which reviews plans and progress against goals on a quarterly basis. Our work with organizations is usually in the nature of programmatic support. We work closely with our partners and review the  progress and participate in important decisions along with them during the lifecycle of the project. Our work in education covers a range of initiatives in school and higher education in India and overseas. The common vision that ties this together is our belief that good education is the primary enabler of change towards a better society. Wipro earthian is our flagship program that brings together two of our key programs. In the ‘schools’ segment, Wipro earthian is now present in more than 30  states and union territoriWes across India. In the past couple of years, we have consciously established and  expanded our outreach to the North-East in India and the Northern Himalayas. Wipro earthian covers two phases. The award program for schools engages students under two thematic areas - Water and  Biodiversity. Participating schools form teams and engage in an intensive 5-month program. The engagement with colleges is more selective and aligned with the particular characteristics of  different disciplines and institutes. The CEP provides unique learning experiences for schools and colleges. The CEP also accelerates sustainability learning at an institutional level. Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21 102 Adapting to the crisis – Case Study. With the outbreak of COVID-19, this year has brought an increase in the number of CEPs. The pandemic pushed us to revisit our strategy in two ways. To encourage students and educators to reflect on the pandemic within their local contexts. To adapt to the limitations faced by teachers and students to undertake the activities in our program. In such circumstances, programs such as Wipro earthian are ever more relevant. Students were also encouraged to reflect  on how this pandemic has changed for the better or for worse, the lives of people around them. Similarly,  college students had to explore the three areas of Water, Waste, and Health and Well-being. ""We recalibrated our  program to deliver all our teacher-training workshops online through various platforms. Our partners and  educators have started and adapted well to the online mode of delivery,"" she says. ""We have collaborated with Centre for Environmental Research & Edu. (CERE), Mumbai, to develop a digital repository,"" she adds. A new revised theme on ‘Water’ for the Wipro earthian school program launched. 3 digital e-learning modules created for the school themes of Biodiversity, Waste and Water. Continued partnership with Xavier School of Education. Sustainability and collaboration with other leading  institutes to develop sustainability pedagogy tools for faculty across various disciplines/subjects. 2nd cohort of Wipro Sustainability Educator Program launched to support grassroots environment educators across India with 6. 1 faculty-led research grant on the theme of ‘Business and Human Rights’ and 2 post-doctoral  student sustainability fellowships IIM- Bengaluru. 15 students from 6 colleges with diverse  sustainability non-profit and consultancy organizations - CDP, CSTEP, WRI. Wipro earthian Sustainability quiz conducted on a virtual quizzing platform. The 10th edition of the Wipro earthian awards were held virtually for the first time on the 13th of February, 2021. With 124 partners across 26 states and UTs in the country, this program has managed to achieve 103 reforms. Wipro has one of the largest and most diverse networks of educational CSOs in the world. In 2015, as part of our expansion strategy to reach out to  younger and early-stage organizations, we initiated the Wipro Education Fellowship program under the School Education programs. Since inception, we have supported  200+ organizations through 250+ educational projects and initiatives. The impact of this wide network of education organizations has been in the areas of curriculum, textbooks, teacher capacity, and school leadership among other aspects. Education Fellows’, who are founders of early- stage education NGOs, working on multiple domains of education. In FY 2021, we continued to build  momentum of identifying and supporting new and young organizations in school education through a  structured program of fellowships. 13 Fellows from 9 organizations were added during the year taking the total number of ‘Fellows’ to about 116. We hope we will eventually help to build a bulwark of strong organizations across the country which are deeply committed to change in school  education. The 19th Partners’ Forum was a well-attended 2-day event that saw over 200 participants representing 100+ organizations. Apart  from this, a series of capacity building workshops on educational and organizational aspects were held virtually this year. In addition, two workshops on organizational leadership and development were also piloted. 9 new organizations based in 7 states/UT (including underserved regions such as Ladakh and North  East) have been supported in FY21 under the Education Fellowship program. A periodic newsletter/journal (Samuhik Pahal) was  started this year to capture and share partners’ experiences. Four capacity-building workshops on educational and organizational aspects were held virtually this year. Two workshops on organizational leadership and development were also piloted. Mentoring program with organizations such as Shikshamitra and Vikramshila were adapted to address the challenges posed by the pandemic. 19th Partners’ Forum was organized on the topic of ‘adaptations in the time of COVID’ It was a  well-attended 2-day event which saw over 200 participants representing 100+ organizations. A periodic newsletter/journal (Samuhik Pahal) was started to capture and share partners’ experiences. Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF) works in diverse environments: from coral reefs to tropical rainforests,  wetlands to deserts, and coasts to high mountains. Since 1996 NCF has been exploring, understanding  and conserving the natural world through research and responsible engagement with society. Wipro partnered with NCF to take the benefits of creative intersections of their work to school children and larger audiences. Wipro’s support enabled a new program to be created within NCF. The Education and Public Engagement Programme (EPE) aims to increase the connection between people and nature. They have developed, displayed and distributed nature education material primarily for  children. They have researched and written about nature for a young audience. While the nature material they were producing was used a lot, they were often asked by  teachers and educators on how they could also introduce nature education programs. In late 2018 partnering with Wipro Foundation, they started to work on developing Nature  Classrooms. The project works closely with primary school teachers and educators to connect learning to the natural world. Here are the key highlights of their work: Developed user-friendly nature learning resources that are age appropriate, locally and culturally relevant that encourage children to engage with nature through hands-on and inquiry-based learning. Conducted capacity-building workshops for school teachers and educators across different organiza­ tions. Since March 2020, these have been offered in a hybrid or remote-learning format as needed due to the pandemic. Wipro Science Education Fellowship (SEF) is a two-year program designed to improve individual teacher practice and foster teacher leadership opportunities. The program, funded entirely by Wipro, consists of a rigorous selection process that identifies cohorts of experienced science teachers each year. The entire program  has been developed at the Center of Science and Mathematics in Context (COSMIC) at UMass Boston. It is designed as a two-year fellowship program. Over 50,000 children through online (adapted due to the pandemic situation) and direct engagements were supported through our 97 Fellowship and Grant partners across 23 States and UTs. have 7 university partners  - University of Massachusetts, Boston; Montclair State University, New Jersey; Mercy College, New York;. Supported the educational needs of over 2200  underprivileged children with disabilities, through 14 projects in 5 states. This year, the pandemic forced a re-imagination of engagements, which saw all partners putting in efforts to adapt their programs and interactions via online platforms such as Zoom. 105 Stanford University, California; University of Missouri, Jefferson City, University of South Florida, Tampa;  University of North Texas, Dallas- working with 600 teachers across 35 school districts in 7 states. Wipro launched the Wipro Science Education Fellowship program in the UK in FY 2019 in partnership with Kings  College, London (KCL) and Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) A three- year agreement was finalized with KCL, to develop and offer UK’s first master's degree program.  SHU supports a two-year ‘Wipro Teacher Fellowship’ and ‘ Wipro  Teacher Mentor’ programs to provide rigorous continuous professional development to STEM teachers. The program has supported 50+ Fellows in two cohorts till now and gained recognition in the local education eco-system. KCL plans to initiate the recruitment of the third cohort to the program in the coming weeks. SHU is  continuing its engagement program for Cohort 1 and 2 but based on feedback/requests from KCL. They have  shared a proposal on possible ways forward for Wipro-KCL collaboration in the next phase. Wipro has deferred the recruitment of Cohort 3 to Q2-Q3   Both partnerships have created periodic opportunities  for Wipro employees’ engagement. Education is so critical that it is necessary to focus on multiple points of leverage. While systemic reforms are an important area of work, we also have a large program that is designed for more direct impact. The projects address a gamut of critical issues faced by disadvantaged  communities when it comes to school education. These children are from some of the most vulnerable groups in our society – urban slums, HIV-affected families, migrant labor  families, street children. We continue to strengthen our program which supports the educational and rehabilitative needs of children  with disabilities from underprivileged backgrounds. Going beyond just schooling, our approach tries to integrate enabling factors like availability of nutrition, community support, specially trained teachers, assistive technology, access to healthcare  etc. Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21 focuses on early intervention and  inclusive education. Partnering for Social Change focuses on categories of disability and early intervention. People with the right skills and competencies form the bedrock of IT services organizations. In 1995, we started a program for science graduates that would enable them to study for a post-graduate  degree in engineering and technology. The Wipro Academy of Software Excellence (WASE) program helps Science graduates to study  for a master’s degree in Software Engineering. Wipro runs a number of programs with BITS-Pilani, India. Wipro Infrastructure Management School (WIMS) aims to develop and nurture an exclusive talent in IT infrastructure business. WIPro Software Technology Academy (WiSTA) is a collaboration with Vellore. Since its inception in 1995, Wipro has supported and enabled more than 34,000 students to pursue their higher education in Engineering. Over 26,100students successfully completed their M. Tech degree in various IT disciplines over the last year. TalentNext’s focus is to improve the overall quality of engineering education in India. During FY21 the total number of new entrants into the work integrated  learning program was 2682. The aggregate strength across four years was about 8040. The  program has helped train about 400 Professors from 169 Engineering colleges on Digital Technologies. Wipro offers Digital Technology courses to the faculty members for 2 weeks on Industry relevant skills and certify them. Such certified faculty are called Wipro Certified faculty (WCF) They in turn leverage our course contents, platform, assignments, case studies and assessments to train their 6th semester students as part of the curriculum. In FY21, we trained 222 faculty from 141 colleges. these faculty must go through a 250-hour self-directed learning and qualify the  coding challenge to participate in Wipro’s campus selection process. Till date we have trained 100 leaders and  60,000+ students through this approach. We also trained 200+ Professors  from 81 colleges on Advanced Technologies such as Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and Wipro has a presence in 50+ countries around the world with 220,000+ employees from 130+ nationalities. We offered NASSCOM’s FutureSkills for 10000 students in 20 Engineering colleges in India. We also launched the second phase of FutureSkill program for 20,000 students from 50 colleges. At its core, social responsibility and sustainability must transcend and  should not be restricted to India. For a global company like ours. it is crucial to engage with proximate communities wherever we have a significant presence. Issues of healthcare,  education, access to energy, water and sanitation and livelihoods. Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21 107 principle of our CSR strategy is that we must engage meaningfully with disadvantaged communities. Our work is channeled through Wipro Cares, a unique platform that is based on the operating model of employee contributions. Wipro works with partners who  provide quality primary health care services to underserved communities. More than 3,85,562  people belonging to extremely disadvantaged communities in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Wipro says. Access toPrimary Health Care is a key determinant of an individual’s future trajectory in life. Nagaland, NCR, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, West Bengal through 16 projects. Our work, in these states, is  mainly in the urban slums, and rural villages where health care access has been weak or non-existent. Our operating approach is driven by the primary goals of building the capacity of Natural disasters like earthquakes, floods and cyclonic storms are an unfortunate fact of life, especially in a climatically and geologically diverse country like India. Whenever these happen, the disadvantaged  sections get affected the most, as the already fragile livelihoods get disrupted further. Starting with the Gujarat earthquake in 2001, we have responded to several natural calamities. Wipro’s employees have also risen to the occasion and played a sterling role. The nature of engagement varies depending on the individual context of the geography, culture and larger socio-economic realities of the region. The disaster was compounded by global pandemic  COVID-19. on women headed households, elderly, and persons with disabilities (PwDs) in areas of Kolkata. We provided new fishing equipment and gear to 155 affected fishermen and livelihood training to 10 women Self Help Groups (SHGs) to bhoi community of Puri, Odisha. The Disaster  Management Committee (DMC) was revived, and community-based Task Force (TF) was formed to ensure women representation and participation for disaster. The DMC & TF were also proactive in providing early warning alerts during the recent cyclone  Amphan (2020) where the entire community was evacuated to a safer place. Apart from conducting a significant relief donation drive, we are supporting three  projects spread across communities heavily impacted by the floods. In Kottayam, our focus remained on strengthening the existing livelihood of 149 flood affected fishermen by restoring the damaged fishing equipment and gear. In Alleppey, we provided fishing boats to154 flood affected fisherman and focused to strengthen and  build capacity of the Disaster Management Committee on community resilience. Ecology Agro-forestry project in rural Tamil Nadu helped around 400 farmers in effectively implementing integrated farming by planting 40,000 trees. Urban solid waste management project in Bengaluru and Mysore provides social, nutritional and health security to nearly 13,000 workers in the informal sector of waste. In response to cyclone Amphan, provided utilities and shelter to 4500 affected families in Kolkata, West  Bengal. Community ecology project in rural Tamil Nadu helped aggregate 400 farmers in planting 40,000 trees and promoting Agro-forestry. to primary health care  across India. Wipro employees are currently engaged with Wipro Cares either through volunteering or by way of monetary contributions or both. Around 25,000 Wipra Employees contributed monetarily during FY 2021. During FY 2021, our on-ground volunteering operations were not fully functional due to Covid. Around 500 employees contributed about 1500 hours in helping Wipro Cares partners, distributing dry ration and hygiene kits, and organizing awareness and health camps. Around 700 employees spent about 2000 hours in help Wipra Caring partners creating policies, training  on recruitment of people, mentoring the youth and tele-screening to patients. Thousands of employees across  six continents and 36 countries came together virtually to participate in the Spirit of Wipro (SoW) Run. In the US and Canada, through our various initiatives with First Book, over 60,000 books were donated, impacting more than 28,000. Other initiatives included tree plantation drive in UKI and Romania, coastal clean-up drive in Philippines, education for disadvantaged particularly children with disabilities in Singapore, South Africa and UKI. In addition, a global donation program was conducted for Wipro employees to support communities that are  disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. The program supported six organizations - First Book, Project HOPE, Save The  Children, Food Banks Canada, Oxfam, Hunger Free America, across the globe. For each donation made by the employee, Wipro matched  the contribution with 2:1. Wipro’s Covid response involved working closely with around 100 non-government organizations (NGOs) who were engaged directly on the ground. In the initial stages of the pandemic (March – June), Wipro's response was focused on humanitarian relief in cities where we have significant operational presence. Wipro worked closely with the Azim Premji Foundation.
