Dear fellow stakeholders,
Welcome to our","Wipro Sustainability Report FY 2020-21 is published by Wipro. The report is presented in three parts. The Executive Chairman’s Letter to stakeholders is the first part of the report. The second part is the Executive Summary and the third is the Report Profile. The last two years have been unprecedented in recent human history. Except during the two world wars, there has probably never been a time when entire populations have had to stay inside. There are several redeeming features we should perhaps be grateful for. Without Covid. vaccines in a remarkably short time, our collective recovery would have been severely impaired. Equally if not more  noteworthy has been the exceptional humanitarian response from our civil society. Azim Premji Foundation and Wipro have been in the forefront of this. The Foundation has been engaged in the stupendous task of ensuring that the vaccination rollout reaches underserved populations in different parts of rural India. Through a carefully planned and diligently executed collaborative  effort with 3900 Primary Healthcare Centers, the program has enabled the public system to fully vaccinate  110 million people across 24 states. Digital technology has played a key role in the fight against the pandemic. If not for cloud-powered digital connectivity, large parts of our economy would have come to a halt. For a company like ours with 230,000+ employees and customers across the globe, it is only because of. ‘Digital’ fatigue and related mental health issues stemming from  long periods of isolation and endless virtual meetings. As we get employees back to a new hybrid mode of. cloud and digital technologies that not only were we able to ensure continuity of  our operations but also serve our customers more strategically.’ Wipro Sustainability Report FY2020-21 4. Global attention last year also prioritized (as it must) climate change. The COP26 conference in Glasgow in November saw a rising groundswell of commitments to Net Zero emissions fr..."
